This allowance was adjusted to NT$7,000 per month as of January 1, 2012, and is issued up through the month in which the recipient dies. In the future, the amount shall be adjusted once every four years. The adjustment shall be made and publicly announced by the Competent Authority at the central government level, with reference to the percentage change of the consumer price index for the most recent year (as issued by the central government’s accounting and statistics agency) in comparison with the consumer price index for the year prior to the previous adjustment. However, where the percentage change is zero or negative, no adjustment shall be made.\r\nThe issuance of the welfare allowance shall be calculated, following a review that concludes that the applicant is qualified, from the month in which was the day on which the application was received.\r\nFollowing a one-year period for informing and educating the public, starting on January 1, 2013, for any elderly farmer who applies to collect the welfare allowance and falls under any one of the following circumstances, the allowance shall not be issued, or shall be suspended until the month when the said circumstance ceases to exist.
