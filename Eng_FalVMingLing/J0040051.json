If the competent authority considers it unnecessary to continue the auction procedure, it may withdraw its request to the competent branch office of the Administrative Enforcement Agency of the Ministry of Justice for the auction, and request the land registration agency to cancel the noted requirement.\r\nThe criteria for defining idle land and land having been used to construct buildings, public announcements, notices, reduction of the time limit for non-attributable causes, reasons supporting request for extension of the time limit, matters noted as requested by the competent authorities, the methods, procedures, and guidelines for deciding appraised market prices, qualifications for bidders for compulsory auction, and the terms for using land acquired under the preceding seven paragraphs shall be prescribed by the central competent authorities."
