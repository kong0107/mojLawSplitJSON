Until the company issuing or privately placing the securities has completed settlement, the certification bank shall exercise the custodial duty of a good administrator in safekeeping the sample of the seal specimen with which the certification bank certifies the securities and the sample specimen of the certified securities.\r\n3. The total amount of securities certified shall be limited to the actual issuance amount within the total issuance amount approved by the competent authority for effective registration and to the total amount of securities for which the payment has actually been paid up.\r\n4.
