		{
			"number": 400,
			"content": "While planning the Common Duct system under the jurisdiction in accordance with Article 8 of this Act, the competent authority shall plan the settings of main duct and supplier duct based on road status, related projects of public works, and coordinating plan proposed by utility agencies (or organizations).\r\nMain ducts shall be installed under the road median or underneath the lanes, the supplier ducts underneath the sidewalk or both sidelanes."

		{
			"number": 500,
			"content": "The alignment of Common Duct shall meet the following requirements:\r\n1.Align the same plane with the road, and adjust it based on road ststus, the situation of underground embedment and related project of public works.\r\n2.The longitudinal slope shall coincide with the slope of the road with minimum slope not less than 0.2%, except the part of non-typical sections.\r\n3.On curved portion the curvature shall not exceed the maximum allowed radians of the contained utility of piping and wires."
		},
		{
			"number": 600,
			"content": "The distance between common duct’s exterior wall and right of way shall not be less than one (1) meter. However, in case of road alignment change or width limitation of the sidewalk, necessary adjustment may be made upon approval of the competent authority."

		{
			"number": 700,
			"content": "The interior space and dimensions shall meet the following requirements:\r\n1.Net height: Main duct shall have minimum dimension of two hundred and twenty (220) cm; supplier duct shall not exceed one-hundred and fifty (150) cm. However, based on the requirement of pipe capacity, road alignment change or width limitation of the sidewalk, branch ducts can be excluded from these regulations with the approval of the competent authority.\r\n2.Net width: Dased on the need and operation space of contained piping and wires. The width of the aisle shall not be less than eighty (80) cm."
