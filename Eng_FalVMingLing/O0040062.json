			"條號": "Article 4",
			"條文內容": "See the Attached Table 1 for the water quality items and limits prescribed in these Standards.\r\nFor the enterprises discharging wastewater to the special receiving water body in the water pollution total quantity control zone (“total quantity control zones” in brief) that has been announced by the special municipality, county or city competent authority for protecting the farmland water body, the regulations in Table 2 shall be applicable to the limits of copper, zinc, total chromium, nickel, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in the effluent. The regulations in table 2 shall not be applicable for the enterprises in the total quality control zones if the wastewater is discharged at a discharging point outside the total quality control zone through the attached pipelines along irrigation canals and all classes of water drainage channels, or jointly discharged through the pipelines, or if the wastewater is discharged at a discharging point in the total quality control zone but not to the special receiving water body."

			"條號": "Article 10",
			"條文內容": "When an enterprise belongs to two or more industry types, the mixing, treatment and discharge of wastewater shall comply with the effluent standards for each industry type. When identical control items have different control limits, effluent shall comply with the stricter of the two limits. When the quantity of wastewater from one industry type is 75% or more of the total wastewater quantity from all industry types and independent cumulative measuring equipment has been installed, the enterprise may apply with the competent authority to make the effluent standards of the said industry type the basis for all control items.\r\nThe percentage of wastewater as stated in the foregoing paragraph shall be calculated according to records starting from six months prior to the date of application."
