When b < 5 (h-6) and does not fall under the conditions of subparagraph 2, which means that when the distance from the pollution source to a building is very far or a building is lower than 6 m (meters), the conical area of a pollution source measured at a downward 12 degree angle from the center of an emissions pipe outlet does not intersect with the buildings of other people.\r\n        q=a2‧25‧ (h-6) ^2"
