			"條文內容": "\"Financial reports\" shall mean financial statements, statements of major accounting items, and any other disclosures and explanatory information helpful to the decision making of the primary users.\r\nA complete set of financial statements shall comprise a balance sheet, a statement of comprehensive income, a statement of changes in equity, a statement of cash flows, and their accompanying notes or supplementary schedules.\r\nAn issuer, unless newly established, or under any of the circumstances set out in paragraph 4 herein, or otherwise required by the FSC, shall prepare the major financial statements and notes described in the preceding paragraph by presenting comparative information for two consecutive periods. The major financial statements shall also be signed or sealed on each page by the issuer's chairperson, managerial officer, and principal accounting officer.\r\nWhen an issuer applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial reports, or when it reclassifies items in its financial reports, it shall do so in accordance with the applicable provisions of IAS 1.\r\nFor the purposes of these Regulations, information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring the information in the financial reports could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of information in those financial reports. Judgments of materiality depend on qualitative factors and quantitative factors. Whether information is quantitatively material is assessed by considering not only the size of the impact recognized in the financial report, but also any unrecognized items that could ultimately affect primary users' overall perception of the issuer's financial position, financial performance and cash flows (e.g., contingent liabilities or contingent assets). When assessing qualitative factors, consideration shall be given to both issuer-specific and external qualitative factors, including involvement of a related party, uncommon transactions or features of a transaction, unexpected variation or changes in trends, the issuer's geographical location, its industry sector, or the state of the economy or economies in which it operates."

If the adjusted amount reaches the threshold set by the FSC, a corrected financial report shall be publicly disclosed, together with a description of the reasons, items, and amount specified in the FSC notice for adjustment."

			"條號": "Article 6",
			"條文內容": "The following shall apply when an issuer makes an accounting change:\r\n1. Changes in accounting policies:\r\nA. \"Accounting policies\" are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices applied by an entity in preparing and presenting financial statements.\r\nB. When an issuer changes an accounting policy voluntarily in a new financial year in order to produce financial reports that provide reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions or other events or conditions on the issuer's financial position, financial performance, or cash flows, it shall request its attesting certified public accountants (CPAs) to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the change in accounting policy, the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable and more relevant information, each line item affected and the estimated effect for the financial year preceding the earliest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year. These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors and for recognition by the supervisors, after which they shall be publicly disclosed and filed.\r\nC. If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new financial year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the issuer shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item above, and shall request the attesting CPAs to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the financial year preceding the change in accounting policy. The issuer shall then make a public disclosure and filing according to the above procedure.\r\nD. Unless it is impracticable to determine the effects as described in the preceding item, then within 2 months after the beginning of the financial year in which the new accounting policy is adopted, the issuer shall calculate the line items affected and the actual effect for the financial year preceding the earliest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year, and shall submit those for adoption by the board of directors and for recognition by the supervisors, after which they shall be publicly disclosed and filed, and shall also be submitted to the shareholders meeting for the financial year of the change. If the difference between the actual effect of the change in accounting policy and the effect originally presented in public disclosure and filing is NT$10 million or more, and is also 1 percent or more of net operating revenues for the immediately preceding financial year, or 5 percent or more of paid-in capital, the issuer shall analyze the reasons for the difference and request the attesting CPAs to provide an opinion on its reasonableness. The analysis and the CPAs' opinion shall also be publicly disclosed and filed as described above.\r\nE. If the shares issued by an issuer have no par value or a par value other than NT$10 per share, the threshold of 5 percent of paid-in capital as set out in the preceding item shall be replaced by 2.5 percent of equity attributable to owners of the parent as stated in the balance sheet.\r\nF. If an issuer voluntarily changes an accounting policy or accounting estimate after the beginning of a financial year, it shall publicly disclose and file information on the prior periods affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy, the line items affected and the actual effect for the immediately preceding financial year, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year. The issuer shall also provide additional information on the reasonableness and necessity for the change in an accounting policy or accounting estimate after the beginning of the financial year, and shall prior to public disclosure and filing request the attesting CPAs to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of those and other relevant matters. These shall then be publicly disclosed and filed after being submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors and recognition by the supervisors, and shall also be submitted to the next following shareholders meeting. If the effect of the issuer's retrospective application of a new accounting policy on the financial statements for any quarter of the current fiscal year reaches the standard for restatement of the financial reports as prescribed in Article 6 of the Enforcement Rules of the Act, the issuer shall restate the financial reports for the relevant period and request the attesting CPAs to re-audit or review the financial statements and then re-disclose and file the reports.\r\n2. Changes in accounting estimates:\r\nA. \"Accounting estimates\" means amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty and are estimated by an entity using measurement techniques and inputs.\r\nB. If a change in an accounting estimate arises from a change in the useful life or the depreciation or depletion method of depreciable or depletable assets, a change in the amortization period or amortization method of intangible assets, a change in the residual value of any such assets, or a change in a technique used to estimate the fair value thereof, the issuer shall request the attesting CPAs to provide an analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the changes and the reasons why the changes can provide reliable and more relevant information. Those changes in accounting estimates shall then be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors and for recognition by the supervisors, after which they shall be publicly disclosed and filed, and shall also be submitted to the next following shareholders meeting. If the issuer makes a change in an accounting estimate during a fiscal year, the issuer shall do the same as above, and also shall provide additional information on the reasonableness and necessity of the time of the change.\r\nThe expression \"public disclosure and filing\" or \"publicly disclose and file\" as used in this article means entering the information into the website specified by the FSC for the submission of electronic filings.\r\nIf an issuer has established the position of independent director in accordance with the Act, then when it submits a proposal for resolution by the board of directors pursuant to paragraph 1, adequate consideration shall be given to each independent director's opinion; if an independent director has an objection or reservation, the objection or reservation shall be documented in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors.\r\nIf an issuer has established an audit committee in accordance with the Act, the matters for which paragraph 1 requires recognition by the supervisors shall be subject to the consent of one-half or more of the entire membership of the audit committee, and shall also be submitted to the board of directors for resolution.\r\nThe expression \"entire membership of the audit committee \" as used in the preceding paragraph shall be calculated according to the number of members then actually holding that position."

Property, plant and equipment shall be subsequently measured using the cost model and accounted for in accordance with IAS 16.\r\nC. Each component of property, plant and equipment that is significant shall be depreciated separately.

If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used. The depreciable amount should be allocated on a systematic basis over the asset's useful life.\r\nD. When items of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, or provide economic benefits in different ways, or are subject to different depreciation methods or depreciation rates, the notes to the financial reports shall show each class of their material components.\r\n3.

The income approach shall be used for the valuation of fair value. If, however, undeveloped land cannot be valuated using the income approach, the land development analysis approach shall be adopted instead.\r\nb. When the income approach is used, it shall be subject to the following provisions:\r\nI. Cash flow: Cash flow shall be valuated on the basis of existing lease contracts, rent at local market rates, or current market rents for similar comparable properties in the same location and condition, and overvalued and undervalued comparable properties shall be excluded. If there is a period-end value, the discounted present period-end value may be added.\r\nII. Analysis period: When there is no specified period for the income, the analysis period in principle shall not be longer than 10 years; when there is a specified period for the income, the income shall be estimated for the remainder of the specified period.\r\nIII. Discount rate: The discount rate shall be determined using the risk premium approach only, with the calculation based on a certain interest rate, plus the estimate for the individual characteristics of the investment property. The language \"based on a certain interest rate\" means the interest rate may not be lower than the floating interest rate on a 2-year time deposit of a small amount, as posted by the Chunghwa Post Co., Ltd., plus 0.75 percentage points.\r\nc. Valuation of fair value shall be performed as follows:\r\nI. When the amount of any single item of investment property held is less than 20 percent of paid-in capital and NT$300 million, valuation may be performed through an internal appraisal or outsourced appraisal.\r\nII. When the amount of any single item of investment property held is equal to or greater than 20 percent of paid-in capital or NT$300 million, an appraisal report shall be obtained from a professional appraiser, or the property shall be appraised internally and a CPA engaged to issue a review opinion regarding the reasonableness of the appraisal.\r\nIII.
