			"number": 200,
			"content": "Terms used in these Regulations are defined as follows:\r\nI. \"Fugitive dust\" means particulate matter entrained in the ambient air as a result of anthropogenic (man-made) or natural destruction, disturbance, or weathering effects.\r\nII. \"Closed building\" means a building enclosed by outer walls and a roof, the openings of which, apart from those that have been installed for ventilation in accordance with law, are kept closed at all times.\r\nIII. \"Sealed\" means pollution sources that have been sealed to prevent the dispersal of particulate pollutants in the air.\r\nIV. \"Dustproof screen\" means a facility in the form of a screen used to suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants.\r\nV. \"Dustproof cloth\" means facilities in the form of fabrics, canvas, or plastic cloth used to suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants.\r\nVI. \"Chemical stabilizer\" means particular agents, emulsions, or other chemical agents used to increase the adhesion or cohesion of fugitive particulate pollutants.\r\nVII. \"Automatic water spraying equipment\" means water spraying equipment that can operate automatically and does not require manual operation.\r\nVIII. \"Enclosed gas collection system\" means a gas collection system employing partitions to enclose a stationary pollution source and ensure that it is isolated from other spaces within the plant. A negative pressure must be maintained in space enclosed within such a system when operating, which will ensure that particulate pollutants discharged by the stationary pollution source can be entirely collected by pollution control equipment.\r\nIX. \"Landfill gas collection system\" means a system that employs a hood to gather via dynamic suction or collection of fugitive particulate pollutants discharged by process equipment. Such a system must be able to effectively collect fugitive particulate pollutants from production process equipment. \r\nX. \"Coarse grade aggregate\" means aggregate that can be spread on the ground to prevent the fugitive escape of dust.\r\nXI. \"Particulate matter\" means gravel, crushed stone, slag, or other material that exists in a finely divided form that can prevent the fugitive escape of dust.\r\nXII.  \"Exposed area\" means an area wherein the surface soil is directly exposed to the atmosphere.\r\nXIII. \"Road color difference\" means a difference in the color of a road surface compared with a clean road caused by the adhesion of particulate pollutants such as sand and soil.\r\nXIV. \"Existing pollution source\" means those stationary pollution sources that are naturally existing or that were completed, for which project bid request procedures had been completed, for which contracting contract signing had been completed when there were no bid request procedures, or that were under construction prior to the implementation of these Regulations."

			"number": 300,
			"content": "The appraisal targets of these Regulations shall be those stationary pollution sources at public or private premises that may produce fugitive particulate pollutants listed in Attached Table 1. However, these Regulations shall not apply to construction sites."
		},
		{
			"number": 400,
			"content": "Public or private premises that pile fugitive dust shall establish or adopt one of the following facilities in order to effectively suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants:\r\nI. Piled within a closed building.\r\nII. Apart from entrances and exits, the periphery of a piling area must be enclosed with dustproof screens or partition walls with an overall height of at least 1.25 times the design or actual pile height.\r\nIII. Covering least 80% of the piling area with dustproof cloth or dustproof screen.\r\nIV. Spraying at least 80% of the piling area with chemical stabilizers.\r\nV. Installing automatic water spraying equipment that can spray over the entire piling area and that can spray while materials are piled to ensure that the piled materials are kept moist.\r\nWhen the facilities in subparagraphs 2 through 5 of the foregoing paragraph have been adopted, isolation equipment and spill-prevention bases shall be installed so as to prevent the falling or spilling of the piled materials outside of the piling area."

			"number": 500,
			"content": "Public or private premises that transport fugitive dust shall establish or adopt one of the following facilities in order to effectively collect or suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants. However, premises adopting wet transport shall not be subject to this restriction.\r\nI. Operation within a closed building.\r\nII. Use of a sealed conveyor system.\r\nIII. Landfill gas collection systems or automatic water spraying facilities must be employed at the inlets, outlets, feeder points, and other locations when fugitive emissions of particulate pollutants may occur in conveyor systems."

		{
			"number": 600,
			"content": "A public or private premise using vehicles to transport fugitive dust shall establish or adopt the following facilities to effectively suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants:\r\nI. A vehicle used to transport fugitive dust must employ a sealed cargo container, or use a tightly covered cargo container covered with dustproof cloth or a dustproof screen, which must be securely bound and have a lower edge extending to and covering at least 15 cm below the upper edge of the cargo container. The cargo container of a transport vehicle must possess a function or facility preventing the dripping of wastewater or sludge from the transported material.\r\nII. Routes and spaces within public or private premises where transport vehicles may pass must be paved with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or steel plates, and may not have a color difference from the road. However, such spaces may be covered with coarse grade aggregate or particulate matter when they are located in piling areas or mine or quarry areas, and sprayed with water during operating period to keep the surface moist.\r\nIII. The vehicle body and tires of such a transport vehicle must be washed using pressurized washing equipment before the vehicle leaves the public or private premise, and no fugitive particulate pollutants may adhere to the surface of the vehicle. The entrance and road surface extending 10 m beyond the entrance of a public or private premise may not have fugitive particulate pollutants carried by transport vehicles. In the case of the applicable targets listed under serial number 1-5 in Attached Table 1, automatic vehicle washing equipment must be installed at transport vehicle entrances and exits; the specifications of such automatic vehicle washing equipment are given in Attached Table 2."

			"content": "A public or private premise engaging in processes or operations, or loading and unloading operations, tending to cause the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants shall establish or adopt the one of the following facilities to effectively collect or suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants. However, wet process operations shall not be subject to this restriction. \r\nI. Establishment of an enclosed gas collection system.\r\nII. Establishment of a landfill gas collection system.\r\nIII. Use of sealed operations.\r\nIV. Operation within a closed building.\r\nV. Spraying water during operating times to keep materials moist."
