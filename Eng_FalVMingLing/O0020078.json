			"條號": "Article 2",
			"條文內容": "Terms used herein are defined as follows:\r\nI. “Fugitive dust” means particulate matter entrained in the ambient air as a result of anthropogenic (man-made) or natural destruction, disturbance, or weathering effects.\r\nII. “Closed building” means a building enclosed by outer walls and a roof, the openings of which, apart from those that have been installed for ventilation in accordance with law, are kept closed at all times.\r\nIII. “Sealed” means pollution sources that have been sealed to prevent the dispersal of particulate pollutants in the air.\r\nIV. “Dustproof screen” means a facility in the form of a screen used to suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants.\r\nV. “Dustproof cloth” means facilities in the form of fabrics, canvas, or plastic cloth used to suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants.\r\nVI. “Chemical stabilizer” means particular agents, emulsions, or other chemical agents used to increase the adhesion or cohesion of fugitive particulate pollutants.\r\nVII. “Automatic water spraying equipment” means water spraying equipment that can operate automatically but does not require manual operation.\r\nVIII. “Enclosed gas collection system” means a gas collection system employing partitions to enclose a stationary pollution source and ensure that it is isolated from other spaces within the plant. Negative pressure shall be maintained in the space enclosed within such a system when operating, which will ensure that particulate pollutants discharged by the stationary pollution source can be entirely collected by pollution control equipment.\r\nIX. “Landfill gas collection system” means a system that employs a hood to gather via dynamic suction or collection of fugitive particulate pollutants discharged by process equipment. Such a system shall be able to effectively collect fugitive particulate pollutants from production process equipment.\r\nX. “Coarse grade aggregate” means aggregate that can be spread on the ground to prevent the fugitive escape of dust.\r\nXI. “Particulate matter” means gravel, crushed stone, slag, or other material that exists in a finely divided form that can prevent the fugitive escape of dust.\r\nXII. “Exposed area” means an area wherein the surface soil is directly exposed to the atmosphere.\r\nXIII. “Road color difference” means a difference in the color of a road surface compared with a clean road caused by the adhesion of particulate pollutants such as sand and soil."

			"條號": "Article 4",
			"條文內容": "Public or private premises that pile fugitive dust shall establish or adopt one of the following facilities in order to effectively suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants:\r\nI. Piled within a closed building.\r\nII. Apart from entrances and exits, the periphery of a piling area shall be enclosed with dustproof screens or partition walls with an overall height of at least 1.25 times the design or actual pile height.\r\nIII. Covering at least 80% of the piling area with dustproof cloth or dustproof screen.\r\nIV. Spraying at least 80% of the piling area with chemical stabilizers.\r\nV. Installing automatic water spraying equipment that can spray over the entire piling area and that can spray while materials are piled to ensure that the piled materials are kept moist.\r\nVI. Establishing any other facilities superior than those referred to in the preceding five subparagraphs, upon prior approval of municipal and county (city) competent authorities.\r\nExcept for the entrances and exits, the public or private premises that adopt the facilities referred to in subparagraphs 2 to 5 of the preceding paragraph shall be installed with fences and overflow protection bases to prevent the piled materials from falling or overflowing outside the piling area. Where the premises adopting the facilities referred to in subparagraph 3 or subparagraph 4 of the preceding paragraph are located in a Level-3 fine suspended particulate or suspended particulate controlled area, the coverage area shall account for at least 90% of the piling area.\r\nPublic or private premises that pile fugitive dust with a total designed or actual piling volume of more than 3,000 cubic meters or piling volume of more than 60,000 metric tons per year shall adopt the facilities other than those referred to in subparagraph 2 of Paragraph 1."

			"條號": "Article 5",
			"條文內容": "Public or private premises that transport fugitive dust shall establish or adopt one of the following facilities in order to effectively suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants. However, premises adopting wet transport shall not be subject to this restriction.\r\nI. Operation within a closed building.\r\nII. Use of a sealed conveyor system.\r\nIII. Landfill gas collection systems or automatic water spraying facilities shall be employed at the inlets, outlets, feeder points, and other locations when fugitive emissions of particulate pollutants may occur in conveyor systems."

			"條號": "Article 6",
			"條文內容": "Public or private premises using vehicles to transport fugitive dust shall establish or adopt one of the following facilities in order to effectively suppress the fugitive emission of particulate pollutants:\r\nI. A vehicle used to transport fugitive dust shall employ a sealed cargo container, or use a tightly covered cargo container covered with dustproof cloth or a dustproof screen, which shall be securely bound and have a lower edge extending to and covering at least 15 cm below the upper edge of the cargo container. The cargo container of a transport vehicle shall possess a function or facility preventing the dripping of wastewater or sludge from the transported material.\r\nII. Routes and spaces within public or private premises where transport vehicles may pass shall be paved with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or steel plates, but cannot have a color difference from the road. However, such spaces may be covered with coarse grade aggregate or particulate matter when they are located in piling areas, mine or quarry areas, and sprayed with water during the operating period to keep the surface moist.\r\nIII. The vehicle body and tires of such a transport vehicle shall be washed using pressurized washing equipment before the vehicle leaves the public or private premise, and no fugitive dust may adhere to the surface of the vehicle. The entrance and road surface extending 10 meters beyond the entrance to a public or private premise may not have fugitive dust carried by transport vehicles.\r\nIV. In the case of the applicable targets listed under Item Nos. 1~6 in Table 1, automatic vehicle washing equipment shall be installed at transport vehicle entrances and exits. For the specifications of such automatic vehicle washing equipment, please refer to Table 2, unless the fugitive dust is piled in a closed building at the public or private premises and transported through a sealed conveyor system, subject to prior approval of municipal and county (city) competent authorities."

			"條號": "Article 7",
			"條文內容": "A public or private premise engaging in processes or operations, or loading and unloading operations, tending to cause the emission of fugitive dust shall establish or adopt one of the following facilities to effectively collect or suppress the emission of fugitive dust.
