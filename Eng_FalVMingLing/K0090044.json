			"條文內容": "When an enterprise applies for allocation of airport quota, it shall file an application with the CAA, along with its operation plan. The CAA shall ask other enterprises’ demands and equitably allocate such quota to the enterprise depending on actual demands.\r\nIf two or more enterprises file applications and the total amount of airport quota applied is higher than the amount of airport quota remaining unallocated, the CAA shall rate according to the enterprises’ operating plans to make the allocations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The technical rating items of subparagraph 2 of paragraph 1 of Article 6 of Regulations Governing Allocation of International Air Traffic Rights and Charter Flights shall apply to do the previous rating and the calculation period of the safety assessment score is 2 years prior to the end of the month which the CAA asks the enterprises’ demands.\r\nThe CAA shall, when allocating the takeoff and landing quota, give preference to an enterprise that develops a regular route between Taiwan proper and such offshore island areas as Lienchiang County, Penghu County, Kinmen County and Lanyu Township and Lyudao Township of Taitung County, or between an offshore island and its offshore isles.\r\nThe CAA may give preference to an enterprise in allocating airport quotas as dictated by policy demands if the enterprise meets one of the following conditions:\r\n1. It operates a regular offshore island route in such areas as Lienchiang County, Cimei Township and Wang-An Township of Penghu County or Lanyu Township and Lyudao Township of Taitung County; or\r\n2. It is the enterprise that survived a merger or acquisition one (1) year after the date thereof.\r\nIf the airport quotas must be adjusted or reduced to meet the demands of public interests or military combats, exercises or trainings, the CAA may adjust or retract the airport quotas already allocated to the enterprises.\r\nIf the CAA plans to restore the adjusted or retracted airport quotas mentioned in the preceding paragraph, it shall give preference to the enterprises that originally used such airport quotas unless any of the circumstances set forth in Article 6 hereof occurs."

Within one (1) year after the occurrence of any aircraft accident; provided that the accident was apparently not attributable to the enterprise, as determined by the CAA’s Flight Safety Assessmant Committee.\r\nIf an enterprise may not participate in the allocation of airport quota due to the restrictions set forth in Item 5 of the preceding paragraph, but the accident investigation later determined that the accident was not attributable to the enterprise, such restrictions shall then be withdrawn.  If, during the period when such restrictions are imposed, additional allocation of airport quota is made and the said enterprise cannot acquire any quota because it is disqualified under such restrictions, the CAA may consider giving preference to the enterprise when making any allocation of airport quota in the future."
