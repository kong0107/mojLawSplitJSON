Each sampling time shall cover an operating cycle of more than two furnace heat cycles. Sampling and testing shall be conducted in accordance with the methods amended and officially announced by the central competent authority. Those who are not able to carry out sampling and testing in accordance with the methods amended and officially announced by the central competent authority may propose an alternative inspection and appraisal method and submit it to the central competent authority for review. Following approval by the central competent authority, the authorized inspection and appraisal method may serve as supporting control data."

The temperature of exhaust gas at the inlet of the electric arc furnace dust collection equipment shall be maintained at less than 200 degrees Celsius. Monitoring facilities shall be installed for the real-time display of the exhaust gas temperature at the inlet of the dust collection equipment.\r\nII. Those using activated carbon injections to reduce dioxin emissions must record the quantity of the activated carbon that is injected every hour. The quantity of activated carbon injected during normal operation of an electric arc furnace may not be lower than the average hourly injection quantity of activated carbon of the same specifications used during the most recent test results that have met the emission standard values of the dioxin emission standards in Article 5. If during operation the specifications of the activated carbon are changed or its injection quantity is reduced, another dioxin test shall be conducted to determine the lower limit value for the injection quantity of activated carbon."

			"content": "Electric arc furnaces in the steelmaking industry shall conduct tests of dioxin in emissions pursuant to the following regulations:\r\nI. Regular tests pursuant to Article 7 shall be implemented at least once a year\r\nII. Seven days before a regular test, a test plan shall be submitted to the local competent authority. If in two consecutive regular tests the dioxin concentrations in the emissions comply with the emission standard values of Article 5, relevant documentary proof may be submitted to the local competent authority to apply for adjustment of testing frequency. However, the adjusted testing frequency may not be less than once every two years. When the results of an inspection by the competent authority or the results of a single regular test exceed the emission standard values of Article 5, the test frequency shall revert to the frequency determined in the foregoing paragraph.\r\nIII. The results of each test shall be submitted to the local competent authority in a test report within 60 days after the test."
