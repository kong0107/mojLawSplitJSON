If a period that the applicant spent in that foreign locality is not consistent with the regular length of a program at that educational institution or the program schedule indicated on its administrative calendar, that period will not be counted.\r\nIf an applicant had an outstanding performance during their study for a bachelor’s degree, the educational institution to which they are applying may make a discretionary reduction to the required period spent undertaking their bachelor’s degree program, taking into due consideration the regulations governing the length of programs at institutions of higher education in that particular foreign country, and the specific circumstances.\r\nIf a person is categorized as having a physical or mental disability as defined in the Special Education Act, the educational institution to which they are applying may make a discretionary reduction to the required time which they spent undertaking their program, taking into due consideration the length of programs at institutions of higher education in that particular foreign country, the extent of their physical and/or mental disability, and other specific circumstances.\r\nIf an applicant undertook a degree program that can be taken concurrently at the same level at a domestic institution of higher education and a foreign one under an international academic collaboration program, the applicant is not permitted to have completed the program entirely at the domestic institution.
