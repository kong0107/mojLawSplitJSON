These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval.\r\nB.If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new financial year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the futures clearing house shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item above, and shall request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the earliest financial year affected by the change in accounting policy for which an application is submitted to the FSC for approval. The futures clearing house shall then follow the procedure described above.\r\nC.Unless it is impracticable to determine the effects as described in the preceding item, then within 2 months after the beginning of the financial year in which the new accounting policy is adopted, the futures clearing house shall calculate the line items affected and the actual effects for the financial year preceding the earliest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy and the actual effects on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year, and shall submit those for adoption by the board of directors, after which they shall be filed with the FSC for recordation. If the difference between the actual effects of the change in accounting policy and the effects originally filed with the FSC is NT$10 million or more, and is also 1 percent or more of net operating revenues for the immediately preceding financial year, or 5 percent or more of paid-in capital, the futures clearing house shall analyze the reasons for the difference and request a CPA to provide an opinion on its reasonableness. The analysis and the CPA's opinion shall also be filed with the FSC.\r\nD.Except when applying a new accounting policy to newly purchased assets, in which case the provisions of the preceding items need not be applied, if a change in accounting policy is applied without having been duly filed for approval, the financial reports for the financial year in which the new accounting policy was applied shall be restated, and the new accounting policy may only be applied from the next financial year after a supplementary filing has been made and approved.\r\nE.If the shares of the futures clearing house have a par value other than NT$10 per share, for the calculation of the 5 percent of paid-in capital under item C, 2.5 percent of the equity attributable to the owners of the parent as stated in the balance sheet shall be substituted.\r\n2.With respect to any matter in accounting estimates relating to a change in the useful life or depreciation method of depreciable assets, a change in the amortization period or amortization method of intangible assets, or a change in the residual value of any such assets, in addition to complying with item D of the preceding subparagraph, a futures clearing house shall request a CPA to provide an analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the changes in accounting estimates and the reasons why the changes in accounting estimates would provide reliable and more relevant information.

In no case shall there be more than 3 months difference between the balance sheet date of the associate and that of the futures clearing house. If a CPA determines, pursuant to Statement of Auditing Standards No. 51, that an associate has a material effect on the fair presentation of the financial reports of an futures clearing house, the financial reports of the associate shall be audited by a CPA in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Certification of Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and generally accepted auditing standards.\r\nC.If an investment accounted for using the equity method is pledged as collateral or otherwise subject to any restriction or limitation, that fact shall be noted.\r\n2.Property and equipment:\r\nA.Tangible asset items that are held for use in the supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes, and that are expected to be used during more than 1 financial year or 1 operating cycle.\r\nB.Property and equipment shall be subsequently measured using the cost model and accounted for in accordance with IAS 16.\r\nC.Each component of property and equipment that is significant shall be depreciated separately.

If any such evidence exists, the FCM shall recognize the amount of any impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36. If the recoverable amount of non-financial assets is determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal, disclose the extra information regarding the fair value measurement, including the level of the fair value hierarchy, the valuation techniques, and the key assumptions. If the recoverable amount is determined on the basis of value in use, disclose the discount rate for value in use measurement.\r\nWith respect to the items described in paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 in relation to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive profit or loss, financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets for hedging, trade receivables, other receivables, non-current assets held for sale, and investment property, the measurement and disclosure of fair value shall be made in accordance with IFRS 13.\r\nThe items described in paragraphs 3 and 4 in relation to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive profit or loss, financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets for hedging, shall be distinguished as current and non-current based on liquidity."

Operating capital for clearing business is presented as an item under other non-current assets in the balance sheet of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment), and operating capital is presented as an item under equity in the balance sheet for the futures clearing segment. However, in preparing a consolidated balance sheet, these two items shall be offset against each other rather than being presented separately.\r\n2.Intra-entity accounts–clearing segment: In the case of a futures exchange or other institution concurrently operating the business of a futures clearing house, these are monetary transactions between a non-futures clearing segment and the futures clearing segment. For such intra-entity accounts, a debit balance is presented as an item under other assets in the balance sheet of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) or in the balance sheet for the futures clearing segment, and a credit balance as an item under other liabilities in the balance sheet of the futures exchange or other institution (excluding the futures clearing segment) or in the balance sheet for the futures clearing segment. However, in preparing a consolidated balance sheet, a net balance shall be presented after offsetting debits against credits, provided that the details shall be indicated in the notes to the financial reports."
