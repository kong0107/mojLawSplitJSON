The identity of the natural person（s）who ultimately has a controlling ownership interest in the legal person. A controlling ownership interest refers to owning directly and／or indirectly more than 25 percent of the legal person’s shares or capital；a financial institution may ask the customer to provide its list of shareholders or other documents to assist in the identification of persons holding controlling ownership interest.\r\nB.

A financial institution shall advise its customer in advance that the business relationship will be terminated if verification cannot be completed as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\n10. Where a financial institution is unable to complete the required CDD process on a customer, it should consider filing a suspicious transaction report on money laundering or terrorist financing（STR）in relation to the customer.\r\n11. If a financial institution forms a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing and reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-off the customer, it is permitted not to pursue that process and file an STR instead.\r\n12. The CDD process for e-payment accounts shall follow relevant provisions in the Regulations Governing Identity Verification Mechanism and Transaction Limits for Users of Electronic Payment Processing Institutions, to which the provisions of Subparagraphs（4）～（7）hereof do not apply.\r\n13.

			"條文內容": "The CDD measures of a financial institution shall include ongoing customer due diligence and observe the following provisions：\r\n1. A financial institution shall apply CDD requirements to existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk, and to conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times, taking into account whether and when CDD measures have previously been undertaken and the adequacy of data obtained. The aforementioned appropriate times include at least：\r\n（1）When the customer opens another new account, registers another new electronic stored value card, registers another new e-payment account, increases the amount insured irregularly or enters new business relationships with the financial institution；\r\n（2）When it is time for periodic review of the customer scheduled on the basis of materiality and risk；and\r\n（3）When it becomes known that there is a material change to customer’s identity and background information.\r\n2. A financial institution shall conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship to scrutinize transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the customer, its business and risk profile, including, where necessary, the source of funds.\r\n3. A financial institution shall periodically review the existing records to ensure that documents, data or information of the customer and its beneficial owner（s）collected under the CDD process are kept up-to-date and relevant, particularly for higher risk categories of customers, whose reviews shall be conducted at least once every year.\r\n4. A financial institution can rely on existing customer records to undertake identification and verification. Therefore, a financial institution is allowed to carry out transactions without repeatedly identifying and verifying the identity of an existing customer. However, a financial institution shall conduct CDD measures again in accordance with Article 3 herein if it has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of the records, such as, where there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer, or where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s account is operated, which is not consistent with the customer’s business profile."

			"條文內容": "A financial institution shall determine the extent of applying CDD and ongoing due diligence measures under Subparagraph 4 of Article 3 and the preceding article using a risk-based approach（RBA）：\r\n1. For higher risk circumstances, a financial institution shall perform enhanced CDD or ongoing due diligence measures by adopting additionally at least the following enhanced measures：\r\n（1）Obtaining the approval of senior management before establishing or entering a new business relationship；\r\n（2）Taking reasonable measures to understand the sources of wealth and the source of funds of the customer；in case the source of funds is deposits, understand further the source of deposits；and\r\n（3）Conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of business relationship.\r\n2. For customers from high ML／TF risk countries or regions, a financial institution shall conduct enhanced CDD measures consistent with the risks identified.\r\n3. For lower risk circumstances, a financial institution may apply simplified CDD measures, which shall be commensurate with the lower risk factors. However simplified CDD measures are not allowed in any of the following circumstances：\r\n（1）Where the customers are from or in countries and jurisdictions known to have inadequate AML／CFT regimes, including but not limited to those which designated by international organizations on AML／CFT as countries or regions with serious deficiencies in their AML／CFT regime , and other countries or regions that do not or insufficiently comply with the recommendations of international organizations on AML／CFT as forwarded by the Financial Supervisory Commission（FSC）；or\r\n（2）Where there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing in relation to the customer or the transaction.\r\nThe provisions of Items（1）and（2）of Subparagraph 1 of the preceding paragraph do not apply to electronic stored value card registration operation.\r\nAn insurance enterprise should consider the beneficiary of a life insurance policy as a relevant risk factor in determining whether to apply enhanced CDD measures. If the insurance enterprise determines that a beneficiary who is a legal person or a trustee presents a higher risk, the enhanced CDD measures should include reasonable measures to identify and verify the identity of the actual beneficiary before making benefit payout."

However if it is otherwise permitted by law or the FSC that a financial institution may reply on third parties to perform the identification and verification of the identities of customers, agents and beneficial owners or the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, the financial institution relying on the third party shall still bear the ultimate responsibility for CDD measures and comply with the following provisions：\r\n1. A financial institution relying on a third party should be able to immediately obtain the necessary CDD information.\r\n2.

For a PEP who is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function by a R.O.C. government, a foreign government or an international organization, a financial institution shall assess the level of influence that the individual could still exercise by considering relevant risk factors and determine whether to apply the provisions of the preceding three subparagraphs based on the RBA.\r\n5. The preceding four subparagraphs apply to family members and close associates of PEPs. The scope of family members and close associates mentioned above will be determined in a manner stipulated in the latter section of Paragraph 4, Article 7 of the Act.\r\nProvisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply when the beneficial owner or senior managerial officer of a customer specified under sub-items（A）～（C）and（H）of Item（3）, Subparagraph 7 of Article 3 herein is a PEP.\r\nInsurance companies and post offices engaging in simple life insurance business should take reasonable measures to identify and verify whether the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, investment-linked insurance policy or annuity insurance policy and the beneficial owner of the beneficiary are PEPs referred to in the preceding paragraph before paying out benefit or cash surrender value. In case high risk circumstances are discovered, an insurance enterprise should, prior to paying out policy proceeds to PEPs, inform senior management, conduct enhanced scrutiny on the whole business relationship with the policyholder, and consider making a suspicious ML／TF transaction report."
