			"條文內容": "A financial institution shall comply with the following provisions in undertaking customer due diligence (CDD) measures：\r\n1. A financial institution shall not accept anonymous accounts or accounts in fictitious names for establishing or maintaining business relationship.\r\n2. A financial institution shall undertake CDD measures when:\r\n(1) establishing business relations with any customer;\r\n(2) carrying out occasional transactions with respect to:\r\nA. a single transaction (including domestic remittances) or a certain number (or greater) of electronic stored value card transactions that meet or exceed a certain amount, or multiple clearly related transactions that in sum total meet or exceed a certain amount; or\r\nB. a cross-border wire transfer involving NTD 30,000 or more (including the foreign currency equivalent thereof);\r\n(3) there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or\r\n(4) the financial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained customer identification data.\r\n3.

When the customer is a legal person, a financial institution shall understand whether the customer is able to issue bearer shares and apply appropriate measures for customers who have issued bearer shares to ensure their beneficial owners are kept up-to-date.\r\n7. When the customer is a legal person, an organization or a trustee, a financial institution shall, in accordance with Item (3) of Subparagraph 4 hereof, understand the ownership and control structure of the customer or the trust, and obtain the following information to identify the beneficial owners of the customer and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of such persons:\r\n(1) For legal persons and organizations:\r\nA. The identity of the natural person(s) who ultimately has a controlling ownership interest in the legal person. A controlling ownership interest refers to owning directly and/or indirectly more than 25 percent of the legal person’s shares or capital; a financial institution may ask the customer to provide its list of shareholders or other documents to assist in the identification of persons holding controlling ownership interest.\r\nB. To the extent where no natural person exerting control through ownership interests is identified or that there is doubt as to whether the person(s) with the controlling ownership interest are the beneficial owner(s), the identity of the natural person(s) (if any) exercising control of the customer through other means.\r\nC. Where no natural person is identified under Sub-item A or B above, a financial institution shall identify the identity of a natural person who holds the position of senior managing official.\r\n(2) For trustees: the identity of the settlor(s), the trustee(s), the trust supervisor, the beneficiaries, and any other natural person(s) exercising ultimate effective control over the trust, or the identity of person(s) in equivalent or similar position.\r\n(3) Unless otherwise provided for in the proviso of Subparagraph 3, Paragraph 1 of Article 6 herein or where the customer has issued bearer shares, a financial institution is not subject to the requirements of identifying and verifying the identity of beneficial owner(s) of a customer set out under Item (3) of Subparagraph 4 hereof, provided the customer or the person having a controlling ownership interest in the customer is\r\nA. a R.O.C government entity;\r\nB. an enterprise owned by the R.O.C government;\r\nC. a foreign government entity;\r\nD. a public company and its subsidiaries;\r\nE. an entity listed on a stock exchange outside of R.O.C. that is subject to regulatory disclosure requirements of its principal shareholders, and the subsidiaries of such entity;\r\nF. a financial institution supervised by the R.O.C. government, and an investment vehicles managed by such institution;\r\nG. a financial institution incorporated or established outside R.O.C. that is subject to and supervised for compliance with AML/CFT requirements consistent with standards set by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), and an investment vehicle managed by such institution;\r\nH. a fund administered by a R.O.C. government entity; or\r\nI. an employee stock ownership trust or an employee savings trust.\r\n(4) Except for situations provided for in the proviso of Subparagraph 3, Paragraph 1 of Article 6 herein, a financial institution is not subject to the requirements of identifying and verifying the identity of beneficial owner(s) of a customer set out under Item (3) of Subparagraph 4 hereof when the customer purchases property insurance, accident insurance, health insurance or an insurance product that does not require policy value reserve.\r\n8. An insurance enterprise shall adopt the following measures when the beneficiary(ies) on a life insurance policy, investment-linked insurance policy or annuity insurance policy have been identified or designated:\r\n(1) Obtaining the name and identification document number or registration (incorporation) date of the designated beneficiary; and\r\n(2) For beneficiary(ies) that are designated by contract characteristics or by other means, obtaining sufficient information concerning the beneficiary to satisfy the insurance enterprise that it will be able to establish the identity of the beneficiary at the time of the payout.\r\n(3) Verifying the identity of the beneficiary(ies) at the time of the payout.\r\n9. A financial institution shall not establish business relationship or conduct occasional transactions with a customer before completing the CDD process. However, a financial institution may first obtain information on the identity of the customer and its beneficial owner(s) and complete the verification after the establishment of business relationship, provided that:\r\n(1) The ML/TF risks are effectively managed, including adopting risk management procedures with respect to the conditions under which a customer may utilize the business relationship to complete a transaction prior to verification;\r\n(2) This is essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business with the customer; and\r\n(3) Verification of the identities of the customer and its beneficial owner(s) will be completed as soon as reasonably practicable after the establishment of business relationship. A financial institution shall advise its customer in advance that the business relationship will be terminated if verification cannot be completed as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\n10. Where a financial institution is unable to complete the required CDD process on a customer, it should consider filing a suspicious transaction report on money laundering or terrorist financing (STR) in relation to the customer.\r\n11. If a financial institution forms a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing and reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-off the customer, it is permitted not to pursue that process and file an STR instead.\r\n12. The CDD process for e-payment accounts shall follow relevant provisions in the Regulations Governing Identity Verification Mechanism and Transaction Limits for Users of Electronic Payment Processing Institutions, to which the provisions of Subparagraphs (4) ~ (7) hereof do not apply.\r\n13. The provisions of Item (3) of Subparagraph 4 and Subparagraph 6 hereof do not apply to electronic stored value card registration operation."

The customer refuses to provide the required documents for identifying and verifying its identity;\r\n3. Whereas any person acts on behalf of a customer to open an account, register an electronic stored value card, register an e-payment account, apply for insurance, file an insurance claim, request change of insurance contract or conduct a transaction, it is difficult to check and verify the fact of authorization and identity-related information;\r\n4. The customer uses forged or altered identification documents;\r\n5. The customer only provides photocopies of the identification documents; the preceding provision does not apply to businesses where a photocopy or image file of the identification document supplemented with other control measures are acceptable;\r\n6. Documents provided by the customer are suspicious or unclear so that the documents cannot be authenticated, or the customer refuses to provide other supporting documents;\r\n7. The customer procrastinates in providing identification documents in an unusual manner;\r\n8. The customer is an individual, a legal person or an organization sanctioned under the Terrorism Financing Prevention Act, or a terrorist or terrorist group identified or investigated by a foreign government or an international anti-money laundering organization, except for payments made under Subparagraphs 2 ~ 4, Paragraph 1, Article 6 of the Terrorism Financing Prevention Act; or\r\n9. Other unusual circumstances exist in the process of establishing business relationship or conducting transaction and the customer fails to provide reasonable explanations."

			"條文內容": "The CDD measures of a financial institution shall include ongoing customer due diligence and observe the following provisions:\r\n1. A financial institution shall apply CDD requirements to existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk, and to conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times, taking into account whether and when CDD measures have previously been undertaken and the adequacy of data obtained. The aforementioned appropriate times include at least:\r\n(1) When the customer opens another new account, registers another new electronic stored value card, registers another new e-payment account, increases the amount insured irregularly or enters new business relationships with the financial institution;\r\n(2) When it is time for periodic review of the customer scheduled on the basis of materiality and risk; and\r\n(3) When it becomes known that there is a material change to customer’s identity and background information.\r\n2. A financial institution shall conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship to scrutinize transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the customer, its business and risk profile, including, where necessary, the source of funds.\r\n3. A financial institution shall periodically review the existing records to ensure that documents, data or information of the customer and its beneficial owner(s) collected under the CDD process are kept up-to-date and relevant, particularly for higher risk categories of customers, whose reviews shall be conducted at least once every year.\r\n4. A financial institution can rely on existing customer records to undertake identification and verification. Therefore, a financial institution is allowed to carry out transactions without repeatedly identifying and verifying the identity of an existing customer. However, a financial institution shall conduct CDD measures again in accordance with Article 3 herein if it has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of the records, such as, where there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer, or where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s account is operated, which is not consistent with the customer’s business profile."

			"條號": "Article 6",
			"條文內容": "A financial institution shall determine the extent of applying CDD and ongoing due diligence measures under Subparagraph 4 of Article 3 and the preceding article using a risk-based approach (RBA):\r\n1. For higher risk circumstances, a financial institution shall perform enhanced CDD or ongoing due diligence measures by adopting additionally at least the following enhanced measures:\r\n(1) Obtaining the approval of senior management before establishing or entering a new business relationship;\r\n(2) Taking reasonable measures to understand the sources of wealth and the source of funds of the customer; in case the source of funds is deposits, understand further the source of deposits; and\r\n(3) Conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of business relationship.\r\n2. For customers from high ML/TF risk countries or regions, a financial institution shall conduct enhanced CDD measures consistent with the risks identified.\r\n3. For lower risk circumstances, a financial institution may apply simplified CDD measures, which shall be commensurate with the lower risk factors. However simplified CDD measures are not allowed in any of the following circumstances:\r\n(1) Where the customers are from or in countries and jurisdictions known to have inadequate AML/CFT regimes, including but not limited to those which designated by international organizations on AML/CFT as countries or regions with serious deficiencies in their AML/CFT regime, and other countries or regions that do not or insufficiently comply with the recommendations of international organizations on AML/CFT as forwarded by the FSC; or\r\n(2) Where there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing in relation to the customer or the transaction.\r\nThe provisions of Items (1) and (2) of Subparagraph 1 of the preceding paragraph do not apply to electronic stored value card registration operation.\r\nAn insurance enterprise should consider the beneficiary of a life insurance policy as a relevant risk factor in determining whether to apply enhanced CDD measures. If the insurance enterprise determines that a beneficiary who is a legal person or a trustee presents a higher risk, the enhanced CDD measures should include reasonable measures to identify and verify the identity of the actual beneficiary before making benefit payout."

			"條文內容": "A financial institution should perform its own CDD operation. However if it is otherwise permitted by law or the FSC that a financial institution may reply on third parties to perform the identification and verification of the identities of customers, agents and beneficial owners or the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, the financial institution relying on the third party shall still bear the ultimate responsibility for CDD measures and comply with the following provisions:\r\n1. A financial institution relying on a third party should be able to immediately obtain the necessary CDD information.\r\n2. A financial institution should take adequate steps to satisfy itself that copies of identification data and other relevant documentation relating to the CDD requirements will be made available from the third party upon request without delay.\r\n3. A financial institution shall make sure that the third party it relies on is regulated, supervised or monitored, and has appropriate measures in place for compliance with CDD and record-keeping requirements.\r\n4. A financial institution shall make sure that the jurisdiction at where the third party it relies on is based has AML/CFT regulations in place that are consistent with the standards set out by the FATF."

			"條文內容": "When conducting CDD measures, a financial institution shall put in place risk management systems to determine whether a customer and its beneficial owner or senior managerial officer is a person who is or has been entrusted with a prominent function by a domestic government, a foreign government or an international organization (referred to as politically exposed persons (PEPs) hereunder):\r\n1. For a customer or the beneficial owner determined to be a current PEP of a foreign government, a financial institution shall treat the customer directly as a high-risk customer, and adopt enhanced CDD measures under Subparagraph 1, Paragraph 1 of Article 6 herein.\r\n2. For a customer or the beneficial owner determined to be a current PEP of a R.O.C. government or an international organization, a financial institution shall assess the PEP’s risks when establishing business relationship with the person and conduct annual review thereafter.

For a senior managerial officer of a customer determined to be a current PEP of a R.O.C. government, a foreign government or an international organization, a financial institution shall determine whether to apply the enhanced CDD measures under Subparagraph 1, Paragraph 1 of Article 6 herein by considering the level of influence the officer has on the customer.\r\n4. For a PEP who is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function by a R.O.C. government, a foreign government or an international organization, a financial institution shall assess the level of influence that the individual could still exercise by considering relevant risk factors and determine whether to apply the provisions of the preceding three subparagraphs based on the RBA.\r\n5. The preceding four subparagraphs apply to family members and close associates of PEPs. The scope of family members and close associates mentioned above will be determined in a manner stipulated in the latter section of Paragraph 4, Article 7 of the Act.\r\nProvisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply when the beneficial owner or senior managerial officer of a customer specified under sub-items (A) ~ (C) and (H) of Item (3), Subparagraph 7 of Article 3 herein is a PEP.\r\nInsurance companies and post offices engaging in simple life insurance business should take reasonable measures to identify and verify whether the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, investment-linked insurance policy or annuity insurance policy and the beneficial owner of the beneficiary are PEPs referred to in the preceding paragraph before paying out benefit or cash surrender value. In case high risk circumstances are discovered, an insurance enterprise should, prior to paying out policy proceeds to PEPs, inform senior management, conduct enhanced scrutiny on the whole business relationship with the policyholder, and consider making a suspicious ML/TF transaction report."
