A financial institution shall advise its customer in advance that the business relationship will be terminated if verification cannot be completed as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\n10. Where a financial institution is unable to complete the required CDD process on a customer, it should consider filing a suspicious transaction report on money laundering or terrorist financing (STR) in relation to the customer.\r\n11. If a financial institution forms a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing and reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-off the customer, it is permitted not to pursue that process and file an STR instead.\r\n12. The CDD process for e-payment accounts shall follow relevant provisions in the Regulations Governing Identity Verification Mechanism and Transaction Limits for Users of Electronic Payment Processing Institutions, to which the provisions of Subparagraphs (4) ~ (7) hereof do not apply.\r\n13.

A financial institution shall apply CDD requirements to existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk, and conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times, taking into account whether and when CDD measures have previously been undertaken and the adequacy of data obtained. The aforementioned appropriate times shall include at least:\r\n(1) When the customer opens another new account, registers another new electronic stored value card, registers another new e-payment account, increases the amount insured irregularly or enters new business relationships with the financial institution;\r\n(2) When it is time for periodic review of the customer scheduled on the basis of materiality and risk; and\r\n(3) When it becomes known that there is a material change to customer’s identity and background information.\r\n2. A financial institution shall conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship to scrutinize transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the customer, its business and risk profile, including, where necessary, the source of funds.\r\n3. A financial institution shall periodically review the existing customer records to ensure that documents, data or information of the customer and its beneficial owner(s) collected under the CDD process are adequate and kept up-to-date, particularly for higher risk categories of customers, whose reviews shall be conducted at least once every year.\r\n4. A financial institution can rely on existing customer records to undertake identification and verification without the need to repeatedly identify and verify the identity of an existing customer when carrying out transactions. However, a financial institution shall conduct CDD measures again in accordance with Article 3 when it has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of the records, where there is a suspicion of ML/TF in relation to that customer, or where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s transaction is conducted or the customer’s account is operated, which is not consistent with the customer’s business profile."

For higher risk circumstances, a financial institution shall perform enhanced CDD or ongoing due diligence measures, including adopting at least the following additional enhanced measures:\r\n(1) Obtaining the approval of senior management before establishing or entering a new business relationship;\r\n(2) Taking reasonable measures to understand the sources of wealth and the source of funds of the customer.

However simplified CDD measures are not allowed in any of the following circumstances:\r\n(1) Where the customers are from or in countries and jurisdictions known to have inadequate AML/CFT regimes, including but not limited to those which designated by international organizations on AML/CFT as countries or regions with serious deficiencies in their AML/CFT regime , and other countries or regions that do not or insufficiently comply with the recommendations of international organizations on AML/CFT as forwarded by the FSC; or\r\n(2) Where there is a suspicion of ML/TF in relation to the customer or the transaction.\r\nThe provisions of Items (1) and (2) of Subparagraph 1 of the preceding paragraph do not apply to electronic stored value card registration operation.\r\nAn insurance enterprise should include the beneficiary of a life insurance policy as a relevant risk factor in determining whether to apply enhanced CDD measures. If the insurance enterprise determines that a beneficiary who is a legal person or a trustee presents a higher risk, it should take enhanced CDD measures which should include reasonable measures to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owner of the beneficiary at the time of payout."

In case of higher risk business relationship with such customers, the financial institution shall adopt enhanced CDD measures under Subparagraph 1, Paragraph 1 of Article 6.\r\n3. For a senior managerial officer of a customer determined to be a current PEP of the domestic government, a foreign government or an international organization, a financial institution shall determine whether to apply the enhanced CDD measures under Subparagraph 1, Paragraph 1 of Article 6 considering the officer’s influence on the customer.\r\n4. For a PEP who is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function by the domestic government, a foreign government or an international organization, a financial institution shall assess the influence that the individual could still exercise by considering relevant risk factors and determine whether to apply the provisions of the preceding three subparagraphs based on the RBA.\r\n5. The preceding four subparagraphs apply to family members and close associates of PEPs. The scope of family members and close associates mentioned above will be determined by the regulations stipulated in the latter part of Paragraph 4, Article 7 of the Act.\r\nProvisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply when the beneficial owner or senior managerial officer of a customer specified under sub-items (A) ~ (C) and (H) of Item (3), Subparagraph 7 of Article 3 is a PEP.\r\nInsurance companies and post offices engaging in simple life insurance business should take reasonable measures to identify and verify whether the beneficiary and its beneficial owner of a life insurance policy, investment-related insurance policy or annuity insurance policy are PEPs referred to in the preceding paragraph before paying out benefit or cash surrender value. When high risk circumstances are discovered, an insurance enterprise should, prior to paying out policy proceeds to PEPs, inform senior management, conduct enhanced scrutiny on the whole business relationship with the policyholder, and consider making a suspicious ML/TF transaction report."
