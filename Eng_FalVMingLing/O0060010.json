Dustproof equipment shall be required in operating areas containing dust agents.\r\nV.      The floors of those factories engaged in the synthesis of technical grade environmental agents and of operating areas where emulsions, liquid, suspensions, oils, and ultra-low capacity agents are manufactured (or processed) shall be made of impermeable material, may not allow puddling to occur, and shall be equipped with channels and pipes specifically for collecting wastewater and conveying it to a wastewater treatment facility.\r\nVI.     Manufacturing and administrative areas within a factory shall be clearly delineated. All operating areas shall be clearly distinguished, and separation facilities shall be employed to prevent mutual contamination.\r\nVII.    Environmental agent storage areas shall be clearly marked. Those factories storing technical grade environmental agents shall establish special storage areas subject to locking control and separated from other materials. Those environmental agent finished products and semi-finished products in storage must be clearly segregated from other materials."
