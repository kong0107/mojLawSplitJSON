			"content": "The establishment of an environmental agent factory must comply with the following regulations.\r\nI.      Those environmental agent factories manufacturing internal pressure aerosols shall have a surrounding wall or natural barrier, and may not obstruct environmental sanitation and safety.\r\nII.     The manufacturing and storage areas of those factories engaged in the synthesis of highly flammable, highly explosive, or highly toxic technical grade environmental agents shall be a distance of at least 8 meters from the factory's outer wall. Necessary facilities shall be employed to separate manufacturing and storage areas from each other and from other working areas.\r\nIII.    Plant and warehouse structures shall be sturdy and clean. Walls and floors shall be made of concrete, terrazzo, or other easily washable materials.\r\nIV.     Operating areas shall possess good ventilation and may not generate dust. Dustproof equipment shall be required in operating areas containing dust agents.\r\nV.      The floors of those factories engaged in the synthesis of technical grade environmental agents and of operating areas where emulsions, liquid, suspensions, oils, and ultra-low capacity agents are manufactured (or processed) shall be made of impermeable material, may not allow puddling to occur, and shall be equipped with channels and pipes specifically for collecting wastewater and conveying it to a wastewater treatment facility.\r\nVI.     Manufacturing and administrative areas within a factory shall be clearly delineated. All operating areas shall be clearly distinguished, and separation facilities shall be employed to prevent mutual contamination.\r\nVII.    Environmental agent storage areas shall be clearly marked. Those factories storing technical grade environmental agents shall establish special storage areas subject to locking control and separated from other materials. Those environmental agent finished products and semi-finished products in storage must be clearly segregated from other materials."
