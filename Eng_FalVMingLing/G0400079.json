		{
			"number": 600,
			"content": "An enterprise's internal control system shall consist of the following components:\r\n1. Control environment. The control environment is a composite factor that shapes organizational culture and affects employees' awareness of control. Factors affecting the control environment include the integrity, ethical values, and competence of employees; the management philosophy and operating style of the board of directors and management; how employees are recruited, developed, and organized and how authority and responsibilities are assigned; and the attention and direction of the board of directors and supervisors. The control environment provides the foundation for the other components.\r\n2. Risk assessment. Risk assessment is a process by which the enterprise identifies internal and external factors that keep it from achieving its objectives and assesses their impact and probability. The assessment results can assist the enterprise in designing, correcting, and implementing necessary controls in a timely manner.\r\n3. Control activities. Control activities are the policies and procedures that establish a complete and sound control framework and adopt control procedures at all levels to help the board of directors and management ensure that their directives  are carried out. Control activities include policies and procedures for approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, reviews, periodic counting, check of records, segregation of duties, safeguarding of physical security of assets, comparison with plans, budgets, or operating performance in prior periods, and supervision and management over subsidiaries.\r\n4. Information and communication. Information refers to the subject matter identified, measured, processed, and reported by information systems. It includes information, financial or non-financial, pertaining to the objectives in the areas of operations, financial reporting, and compliance with applicable law and regulations. Communication is the provision of information to relevant personnel, either within or outside the enterprise. The internal control system must have mechanisms to generate information necessary for planning and monitoring and to provide information to those who need it in a timely manner.\r\n5. Monitoring. Monitoring is a process to self-inspect the quality of the internal control. It includes assessing the soundness of the control environment; whether risk assessment is timely and accurate; whether control activities are appropriate and accurate; and whether information and communication systems are functioning properly. Monitoring is accomplished either through ongoing monitoring activities or through separate evaluations. The former is routine monitoring in the course of operations, while the latter is the evaluation conducted by different personnel such as internal auditors, supervisors, or the board of directors.\r\nAn enterprise designing and implementing, or carrying out self-inspection of, its internal control system, or a certified public accountant (CPA) engaged to conduct a special audit of the enterprise's internal control system, shall fully consider the components enumerated in the preceding paragraph, and, in addition to the criteria prescribed by the Financial Supervisory Commission, Executive Yuan (FSC), may add additional items as dictated by actual needs."
