The provisions 4.2.2 to 4.2.8 are also applicable and the fuel economy test values shall be rated by the competent authority in other provisions.\r\n4.2.10 Effective from Jan. 1, 2022, for the sedans or station wagons that being sold by the vehicle entity, if its fuel economy value is higher than the correspond average fuel economy target value as listed in provision 4.2.2.2, the multipliers for the calculation of average fuel economy value are set as follows：\r\n4.2.10.1 Over by 10%, set as 1.5;\r\n4.2.10.2 Over by 20%, set as 2;\r\n4.2.10.3 Over by 30%, set as 2.5;\r\n4.2.10.4 Over by 40%, set as 3;\r\n4.2.10.5 Over by 50%, set as 3.5.\r\n4.3 The fuel economy standards listed in Article 6 are applicable to vehicles with importer provided the listing of US certificate being classified as LDT model or with the EU certificate being classified as M1G model."
