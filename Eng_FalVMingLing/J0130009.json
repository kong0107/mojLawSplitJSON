The standard deviation is calculated by the following equation:\r\n┌──────────────────────────────┐\r\n│                    ┌─────────────────    │\r\n│                    │                               2      │\r\n│Standard Deviation =│       (Fuel Economy Value - X)       │\r\n│                    │Σ ───────────────     │\r\n│                    │    Number of Sample Vehicles - 1     │\r\n│                    │                                      │\r\n│                   ˇ                                       │\r\n└──────────────────────────────┘\r\nThe statistical parameters are to be determined based on the number of sample test vehicles, as in the following table:\r\n┌──────┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐\r\n│Number of   │2     │3     │4     │5     │6     │7     │\r\n│Sample      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n│Vehicles    │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n├──────┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤\r\n│Statistical │0.973 │0.613 │0.489 │0.421 │0.376 │0.342 │\r\n│Parameter   │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n└──────┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘\r\n┌──────┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐\r\n│Number of   │8     │9     │10    │11    │12    │13    │\r\n│Sample      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n│Vehicles    │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n├──────┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤\r\n│Statistical │0.317 │0.296 │0.279 │0.265 │0.253 │0.242 │\r\n│Parameter   │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n└──────┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘\r\n┌──────┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐\r\n│Number of   │14    │15    │16    │17    │18    │19    │\r\n│Sample      │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n│Vehicles    │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n├──────┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤\r\n│Statistical │0.233 │0.224 │0.216 │0.210 │0.203 │0.198 │\r\n│Parameter   │      │      │      │      │      │      │\r\n└──────┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘\r\nIf the number of sample test vehicles is equal to or greater than 20, then\r\n┌──────────────────────────────┐\r\n│                                  0.860                     │\r\n│Statistical Parameter = ───────────────      │\r\n│                         ┌─────────────       │\r\n│                         │ Number of Sample Vehicles       │\r\n│                        ˇ                                  │\r\n└──────────────────────────────┘\r\nIn the event that the entity does not apply for retesting, or the results of the retesting do not meet the Fuel Economy Standards under this Article, the certificate of conformity in respect to the vehicle or the model of vehicle covered by the certificate shall be annulled.
