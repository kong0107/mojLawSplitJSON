			"content": "Terms used in these Standards are defined as follows:\r\nI. Acceleration noise standard value means the acceleration noise level measured at a certain distance, in a certain gear while driving.\r\nII. Stationary noise standard value means the stationary noise level measured at a certain engine speed.\r\nIII. Scientific instrument means the instruments and equipment that comply with noise inspection and testing methods announced in accordance with Article 20, Paragraph 3 of the Noise Control Act.\r\nIV. New vehicle model certification means the new model vehicle noise review and testing performed after each type of new vehicle model has been manufactured or imported, and prior to sale or usage.\r\nV. New vehicle testing means noise condition testing performed after a vehicle has passed new vehicle model certification and following a certain period of time or after a designated quantity has been manufactured or imported.\r\nVI. Engine running noise testing of in-use vehicle means non-regular vehicle noise testing at car parks (stations), by the roadside, at diesel emissions testing stations or other suitable locations performed by the competent authority.\r\nVII. In-use vehicle testing means the engine running noise measurement of a motor vehicle carried out with scientific instrument installed in a fixed or non-fixed manner.\r\nVIII. “PMR” denotes the Power-to-Mass Ratio Index, means the ratio of rated maximum net power to mass in running order as defined: total engine net power (kW)/ vehicle mass in running order (metric ton)."
