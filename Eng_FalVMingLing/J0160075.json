			"number": 200,
			"content": "The terms used in these Regulations are defined as follows:\r\n1. Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM): naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) generally contain radionuclides such as uranium, thorium & kalium found in nature or after disintegrations. The nuclear source material or nuclear fuels are excluded. \r\n2. Activity: refers to the number of spontaneous disintegrations occurring in a certain amount of radionuclides at a given time.\r\n3. Specific activity: activity per unit mass.\r\n4. Specific activity index: referred to the summation of the ratio of specific activity to its standard level for each radionuclide contained in the Waste containing Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (hereinafter referred as “ NORM Waste”). The mathematical formula shall be in accord with the appendix table.　\r\n5. Clean-up: the clearance, bury and release of NORM Waste. \r\n6. Site: referred to the building or land used for the treatment, storage and clean-up of NORM Waste."

		{
			"number": 400,
			"content": "The NORM Waste defined in these regulations shall include the following contents:\r\n1. The waste or polluted waste containing technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) under jurisdiction of the Competent Authority by the procedure of announcement according to stipulations in Article 4 of Ionizing Radiation Protection Act.\r\n2. The waste containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) announced by the Competent Authority.\r\nThe announcement against the preceding Paragraph 2 shall be published in Government Communique."
