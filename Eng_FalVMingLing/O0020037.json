The residence time of the combustion gases in the foregoing paragraph shall be greater than one second in existing incinerators, and greater than two seconds in newly installed incinerators.\r\nIII. Carbon monoxide at the stack outlet (CO) shall not be lower than an hourly average value of 100 ppm, exhaust gas oxygen concentration shall use 11% as the reference standard.\r\nIV. Exhaust gas oxygen concentration at the incinerator outlet shall be an average hourly value of more than 6%.\r\nV. The exhaust gas temperature at the dust collection equipment intake shall be lower than 280 degrees Celsius for existing incinerators, and lower than 200 degrees Celsius for newly installed incinerators.\r\nVI. Those who use activated carbon injection equipment to reduce the quantity of dioxin emissions must record the hourly injected quantity of activated carbon.The quantity of activated carbon injected during normal operation of an incinerator may not be lower than the average hourly injection quantity of activated carbon of the same specifications used during the most recent period whose test results complied with dioxin emission standards. If during operation the specifications of the activated carbon are changed or its injection quantity is reduced, another dioxin sampling and analysis shall be conducted to determine the lower limit for the injection quantity. \r\nVII. During startup waste shall only be loaded into the incinerator after auxiliary burners have been activated to quickly raise the temperature inside the combustion unit.\r\nVIII. During shutdown the auxiliary burners shall be activated to maintain the temperature inside the combustion unit and residual combustion waste, or air shall be blocked from entering the combustion chamber, and procedures to extinguish the fire shall be carried out in order to reduce exhaust gas emissions.\r\nIX. The height of the stack exit of incinerators with a handling capacity of more than 4 tons per hour shall be more than 50 meters, while the height of the stack exit of incinerators with a handling capacity of less 4 tons per hour shall be more than 20 meters."

Incinerators with a handling capacity of 4 tons per hour or more that process hazardous industrial waste or infectious medical waste shall conduct at least one regular test per year.\r\nII. Incinerators with a handling capacity of less than 4 tons per hour shall conduct regular tests at least once every two years.\r\nIII. A test plan shall be sent to the local competent authority seven days before a regular test. The results of each test shall be reported to the local competent authority in a test report within 60 days after the test.\r\nIV. If stack emission dioxin in two consecutive regular tests meets the emission standard values of Article 5, relevant documentary proof may be submitted to the local competent authority to apply for an adjustment of the test frequency. After the test frequency has been adjusted, it may not be less than once every two years for incinerators with a handling capacity of four tons per hour or more that process hazardous industrial waste or infectious medical waste. The test frequency may not be less than once every three years for incinerators with a handling capacity of less than four tons per hour.However, when the test results of an inspection by the competent authority or the results of a single regular test exceed the emission standard values of Article 5, the competent authority may demand that regular tests be conducted according to the originally determined test frequency.\r\nV. Incinerators with a handling capacity of less than 4 tons per hour that burn waste with a chlorine content of less than 0. 015% may submit documentary proof to the local competent authority to apply for exemption from testing.However, when necessary, the competent authority may demand the resumption of testing."
