When the customer is a legal person, an organization or a trustee, an agricultural financial institution shall, in accordance with Item C of Subparagraph 3 hereof, understand the ownership or control structure of the customer or the trust, and obtain the following information to identify the beneficial owners of the customer and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of such persons:\r\nA.
