When the customer is a legal person, an organization or a trustee, an agricultural financial institution shall, in accordance with Item C of Subparagraph 3 hereof, understand the ownership or control structure of the customer or the trust, and obtain the following information to identify the beneficial owners of the customer and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of such persons:\r\nA.

An agricultural financial institution should not establish a business relationship or carry out occasional transactions with a customer before completing the CDD process. However, an agricultural financial institution may first obtain information on the identity of the customer and any beneficial owner and complete the verification following the establishment of business relationship, provided that:\r\nA. money laundering and terrorist financing risks are effectively managed, including adopting risk management procedures with respect to the conditions under which a customer may utilize the business relationship to complete a transaction prior to verification;\r\nB. it would be essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business with the customer; and\r\nC. verification of the identities of customer and beneficial owner will be completed as soon as reasonably practicable following the establishment of business relationship. The agricultural financial institution shall terminate the business relationship if verification cannot be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and inform the customer in advance.\r\n8. Where an agricultural financial institution is unable to complete the required CDD process on a customer, it should consider reporting suspicious transactions in relation to the customer.\r\n9. If an agricultural financial institution suspects that a customer or transaction may relate to money laundering or terrorist financing activities and reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-off the customer, it may choose not to pursue that process and file a suspicious transactions report instead."
