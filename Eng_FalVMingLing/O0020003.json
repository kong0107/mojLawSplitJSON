			"條號": "Article 2",
			"條文內容": "Terms used in these Standards are defined as follows:\r\nI. “Drive cycle testing” means use of a chassis dynamometer to simulate specific forms of driving cycle and measurement of air pollutants emitted from a vehicle’s exhaust   pipe during the simulated driving cycle.\r\nII. “Idle testing” means measurement of the concentration of emitted pollutants from the exhaust pipe when a vehicle is idle.\r\nIII. “Judgment by visual determination” means the use of visual methods to determine the concentration of particulate matter in air pollutants emitted by a transportation   vehicle. This work shall be performed by personnel who have completed the central competent authority’s training for transportation vehicles and public or private premise   exhaust smoke visual judgment personnel and hold a qualification certificate.\r\nIV. “New vehicle model certification” means the air pollutant emission review and testing performed after the manufacture or import of each vehicle model, and prior to sales   or use.\r\nV. “New vehicle testing” means air pollutant emission testing performed after a vehicle has passed new vehicle model certification and following a certain period of time or   after a designated quantity has been manufactured or imported.\r\nVI. “In-use vehicle testing” includes regular testing and non-regular testing. Regular testing means air pollutant emission testing performed during regular testing in   accordance with Article 44 of this Act. Non-regular testing means provisional air pollutant emission testing performed when vehicles are in motion or at a stopping place in   accordance with Article 45 of this Act.\r\nVII. “Mass production” means that a product is being formally manufactured for the purpose of sales or use in a production line in accordance with production drawings after   completion of design and commercial realization.\r\nVIII. “Prototype vehicle” means a vehicle that is manufactured by hand or other non-production line method during the model design and development stage and after the   determination of detailed specifications.\r\nIX. “Mass production vehicle” means a vehicle that is being formally manufactured for the purpose of sales or use in a production line in accordance with production drawings   after completion of design and commercial realization.\r\nX. “Reference mass” means the curb weight of a motor vehicle plus a specific weight. The curb weight of a motor vehicle means the weight of the motor vehicle prior to loading   with persons or cargo. The engine shall contain the designated lubricating oil, the radiator shall contain the designated coolant, the fuel tank shall contain the designated   fuel, and the motor vehicle shall contain accessories (spare tire and tools) designated by the original manufacturer. The specific weight means 136 kg, in the case of the urban   driving cycle (hereinafter referred to as FTP-75) in the test types under the US Federal Test Procedures, and 100 kg, in the case of the New European Driving Cycle (hereinafter   referred to as NEDC) or the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (hereinafter referred to as WLTC).\r\nXI. “Model year” means the calendar year in which a vehicle manufacturer began producing the model in mass production.\r\nXII. “Alternative clean fuel” means a new formulation of gasoline, new formulation of diesel fuel, natural gas, LPG, hydrogen, methanol, ethanol or other fuel containing at   least 85% alcohol."
