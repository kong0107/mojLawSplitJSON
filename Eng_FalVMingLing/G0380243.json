			"content": "An electronic payment institution shall carry out identity verification for executing transactions provided in the preceding article, and the security designs for different types of transactions shall comply with the following requirements:\r\n1. Type A transaction security design means a security design that uses a fixed password, pattern lock or gesture lock. In the case of a fixed password, the security design shall meet the requirements set forth in paragraph 2 of Article 5 herein; in the case of a pattern lock or gesture lock, the security design shall meet the requirements set forth in paragraph 3 of Article 5 herein.\r\n2. Type B transaction security design means the security design that uses OTP sent via short message to user's mobile device with an expiration time for the password set and measures taken to prevent the short message from being stolen or forwarded.\r\n3. Type C transaction security design means any of the following security designs:\r\n(1) For security design that uses FISC-II card, an unpredictable check code of terminal equipment should be dynamically generated for each transaction. For each transaction, the user must input his/her card password to generate a transaction authentication code (TAC) for authentication by the card issuing bank; the security design should also include the prevention of third-party access.\r\n(2) For security design that uses OTP, a physical equipment which is not for transaction execution should be used. The OTP has an expiration time set, and the device will be locked if wrong password is inputted three consecutive times and unlocked after proper identity verification. If the physical equipment and the equipment for transaction execution are the same equipment, transaction will be executed only after manual confirmation of transaction content at user end.\r\n(3) If two factors authentication is used, the security design should have any two of the components below:\r\na. Information agreed between the user and the electronic payment institution, which is not known to any third party (e.g. fixed password, pattern lock or gesture lock).\r\nb. A physical device in the possession of user (e.g. password generator, password card, IC card, computer, mobile device, and hardware cryptopattern module): The electronic payment institution should verify that such equipment is the physical equipment held by the user as agreed between the user and the electronic payment institution.\r\nc. Biometric Characteristics of the Users (e.g. fingerprints, face, iris, voice, palm print, veins, and signature): The electronic payment institution shall directly or indirectly verify such biometric characteristics, and adjust the false acceptance rate of biometric characteristics based on its risk tolerance in order to effectively authenticate the user’s identity, and shall allow additional ID verification mechanisms (such as a password) if necessary. Indirect verification will be processed on the user’s device (such as a mobile device). The electronic payment institution will only read the verification result, and shall allow additional source verification if necessary. If indirect verification is adopted, the effectiveness of the user ID verification mechanism shall be assessed in advance.\r\n4. Type D transaction security design means any of the following security designs:\r\n(1) When accepting in-person user transaction, electronic payment institution should check user's identity document and seal or signature.\r\n(2) Security design that complies with the requirements set forth in the Electronic Signature Act.\r\nAfter logging onto the electronic payment platform with the account number and the Type A, Type B, Type C or Type D transaction security design in the foregoing paragraph, under the connectivity control and during the webpage session time limit under item 2, subparagraph 1 of Article 10, the user may process the transaction of that type security design, and the transaction of alternative transaction security design permitted under paragraph 2 of the foregoing Article.\r\nSecurity design provided in Item (2), Subparagraph 4 of the preceding paragraph that complies with the requirements set forth in the Electronic Signature Act may use the certificate mechanism in compliance with the following requirements:\r\n1. Comply with the relevant operating rules of the certificate authority (CA);\r\n2. Verify the legality, accuracy, validity, assurance level and use restrictions of the certificate; the certificate must be issued by a third-party certificate authority approved by the competent authority governing certificates;\r\n3. When serving as the certificate registration authority to accept certificate registration or data change from users, the counter operation should add two factors authentication security design or have another staff at the counter to review the registration or change data;\r\n4. For online update of certificate, user must use the existing, valid private key to sign for the certificate update information and send the information to the registration authority to apply for online update;\r\n5. For certificates used in non-repudiation of the transaction, choose a certificate authority that agrees to be held liable and the certificate application allows the user to generate their own private key;\r\n6. Any certificate issued by a government agency shall be used only for identity verification at the time of registration;\r\n7. Each transaction must be signed to confirm the payment content and authenticate the validity of the certificate; and\r\n8. Private keys for the certificate shall be stored in a hardware security module that complies with Common Criteria EAL 4+ (including at least AVA_VLA.4 or AVA_VAN.5), or FIPS 140-1 Level 2 or above, or other modules having the same security strength to prevent the private keys from being exported or duplicated. If the chip hardware and payment instruction generation use the same equipment, the transaction should be confirmed manually by user before it is completed, or two or more additional security features are added in the transaction process."
