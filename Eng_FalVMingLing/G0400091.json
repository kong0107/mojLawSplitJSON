A principal protection fund shall indicate, in parentheses, in a different color, and in conspicuous print, the principal protection percentage and the type of the fund (either \"principal guaranteed\" or \"principal protected\").\r\n2. Fund type. State whether the fund is an equity fund, bond fund, balanced fund, principal protection fund, fund-of-funds, index fund, exchange-traded fund (ETF), money market fund, umbrella fund, or another type of fund authorized by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).\r\n3.

The following statements to be printed conspicuously:\r\n(1) \"The Financial Supervisory Commission has either approved this fund or allowed its effective registration, but that does not indicate that this fund is risk-free. The past management performance of this SITE does not guarantee any minimum return on investment for this fund. Apart from exercising its duty of due care and diligence, this SITE will not be responsible for the gains or losses of this fund, and does not guarantee any minimum return.\"\r\n(2) For a principal protection fund that is a capital guaranteed fund, print following statement: \"The Financial Supervisory Commission has either approved this fund or allowed its effective registration, but that does not indicate that this fund is risk-free. If, and only if, investors keep this fund until the maturity date, can they enjoy a ____ percent principal guarantee. The guarantee does not cover cases in which investors redeem prior to maturity, or in which there occurs any of the situations requiring termination (as set out in subparagraphs 1 through 6 of Article__ of the trust deed for this fund), and investors are responsible for all relevant fees for the entire investment period, with the redemption price to be calculated using the net asset value at that time. Investors should be aware that prior to the maturity date the net asset value of this fund may fluctuate due to various market factors. Therefore, before trading, investors should be certain that they are fully aware of the risks and features of this fund.\"\r\n(3) For a principal protection fund that is a capital protected fund, state the following: \"This fund is not guaranteed by a guarantor, but achieves the function of principal protection through the use of various investment tools. The Financial Supervisory Commission has either approved this fund or allowed its effective registration, but that does not indicate that this fund is risk-free. If, and only if, investors keep this fund until the maturity date, can they enjoy a ____ percent principal protection. The guarantee does not cover cases in which investors redeem prior to maturity or in which there occurs any of the situations requiring termination (as set out in Article ____ of the trust deed for this fund), and investors are responsible for all relevant fees for the entire investment period, with the redemption price to be calculated using the net asset value at that time. Investors should be aware that prior to the maturity date the net asset value of this fund may fluctuate due to various market factors, and that, because capital protection is not a guarantee, the purpose of principal protection will be unable to be achieved if, for example, an issuer defaults or a credit risk materializes with respect to an investment instrument. Therefore, before trading, the investor should be certain that they are fully aware of the risks and features of this fund.\" The latter part of the paragraph shall be printed in an especially conspicuous manner, such as enlarged bold typeface or a different color.\r\n(4) For a high yield bond fund, include a description of a profile of the typical investor, stated in a different color and in conspicuous type, and also include the following statements: \"Investors are not advised to invest too high a percentage of their investment portfolio in high yield bond funds.\" and \"The Financial Supervisory Commission has approved this fund, but that does not indicate that this fund is risk-free. As high yield bonds are rated below investment grade or are not rated, and are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, this fund may suffer losses due to a rise in interest rate, decline in market liquidity, or in the event that a bond issuer defaults in payment of principal or interest or becomes bankrupt. This fund is not suitable for investors who are unable to bear the associated risks. The past management performance of the fund management company does not guarantee any minimum return on investment for this fund. Apart from exercising its duty of due care and diligence, the fund management company will not be responsible for the gains or losses of this fund, and does not guarantee any minimum return. Therefore, investors should carefully study the prospectus of the fund before subscription.\"\r\n(5) Please see page   to page   for a disclosure of restrictions on the use of the assets of, and the risks of investing in the fund.\r\n(6) In the event there is any misrepresentation or nondisclosure in this prospectus, the SITE, its responsible persons, and any other persons whose signature or seal appear on the prospectus shall be held legally liable.\r\n(7) Web addresses for inquiries regarding the prospectus, including the web address of the information reporting website designated by the FSC, and the web address where the company discloses the relevant prospectus materials.\r\n(8) For a trust enterprise concurrently operating securities investment trust business that has obtained approval from the FSC to keep fund assets in its own custody, explicitly state that the assets of the fund are kept in its own custody and that a trust supervisor has been appointed.\r\n12. Date of printing.\r\nA prospectus prepared for use in an application (or regulatory filing) to offer a securities investment trust fund shall clearly indicate on its cover that it is a draft version for application (or regulatory filing) purposes only.\r\nThe \"fundamental investment policy\" item described in paragraph 1, subparagraph 3 may otherwise provide a note indicating the page number where the information can be found in the prospectus."
