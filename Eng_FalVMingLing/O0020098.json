			"content": "This glossary of terms are to be interpreted with the following meanings:\r\n1. Greenhouse Gas(GHG) refers to  the following substances: carbon dioxide(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons(PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), and others designated by the central competent authority.\r\n2. Climate change adaptation means responses to actualor expected climate stimuli and their effects, which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Adaptation may include \"preventive and/or responsive actions,\" \"private and/or public actions\" and \"autonomous and/or programmatic\" adaptations.\r\n3. GHG emission source (Emission Source)means any unit or process that directly or indirectly releases GHG into the atmosphere.\r\n4. Global-warming potential (GWP)   measures how much heat a GHG traps in the atmosphere. It compares the amount of heat trapped by the gas when compared to a similar mass of carbon dioxide. GWP is calculated over a specific time interval, commonly 20, 100, or 500 years. GWP is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide (whose GWP is standardized to 1).\r\n5. Greenhouse Gas Emissionsarethe sum of different GHG emissions and their corresponding GWPs, which shall be described by CO2equivalent (CO2e).\r\n6. Entity meansa legal person, non-corporate representative or manager, institution, or others who have Emission Sourcesdesignated by the central competent authority.\r\n7. Carbon sink means any process or mechanism which removes a GHG from the atmosphere such as trees, forests, soils, oceans, stratum, facilities, or other sites.\r\n8. Net quantity of the carbon sink means the net quantity of GHG removed from the atmosphere. This quantitycan include GHG removed from the Emission Source or atmosphere due to sequestration.\r\n9. Mitigation means any intervention to reduce the sources or enhance GHG sinks\r\n10. “Low-carbon green growth”means greeneconomic development that boosts greening of existing industries, energy conservation,carbon emission reduction, developing green energy, and R&D into low-carbon energy technologies.\r\n11. Emission Intensity is the average emission rate of GHGper equipment/product/other specified unitfrom a source, which is described by CO2e.\r\n12. Offset means the use of reduction credits to compensate for or deduct emissions made elsewhere by an entity.\r\n13. GHG Early Action Project (Early Action) refers to an offset project proposed by the owner, user or supervisor of the Emission Sources before enactment of the Act in compliance with the emission intensity designated by the central competent authority.\r\n14. Validation means the review of a GHG Offset Project to ensure the project design document complieswithregulations under this Act.\r\n15. GHG Offset Project refers to a project created to earn reduction credits. The project design document shall be validated by the verification body and approved by the central competent authority.Documents must indicate all the facilities, raw materials, items and activities directly associated with the emission reduction or sink enhancement.\r\n16. GHG emission performance standard (EPS) is a benchmark set by the central competent authority in conjunction with the central industry competent authority according to the facilities, products or input/output units of the specific sectors or Emission Sources.\r\n17. Cap meansthe total permitted amount of emissions for a certain period of time under the cap-and-trade scheme.\r\n18. Allowance trading means to exchange emission allowances domestically or internationally in compliance with the designated cap under the cap-and-trade scheme.\r\n19. Emission allowance means the allowance distributed by designated authorities from government allocation, auction, sale, Early Action, GHG Offset Project, EPS or allowance trading under the cap-and-trade scheme. One unit of emission allowance equals to one metric ton of CO2e.\r\n20. Periodic regulatory goalmeans a goal of GHG emission for a certain period of time based on national GHG reduction action plan.\r\n21. Verification is an independent assessment by interview, document review, data analysis, inspection or test to determine the validity and reliability of the GHG inventory and emission reduction (and sink) by the verification body.\r\n22. Accounting is a process to collect, calculate and analyze emissions or sinks.\r\n23. Registration means reporting emissions, sinks, allocations, reductions, auctions, sales or transactions of CO2e to the national registry (Registry) designated by the central competent authority.\r\n24. Allocated emission allowance (allowance) is an emission allowance issued to an Emission Source for a specific period of time by the central competent authority in conjunction with the central industry competent authorities.\r\n25. Sold allowance (sale) is an emission allowance sold to an Emission Source at a fixed price from the central competent authority.\r\n26. Holding account is an account created by the central competent authority to track an Emission Source’s emissions, and transactions of allocations, auctions, sales or reduction credits.\r\n27. Carbon leakage means implementation of cap-and-trade scheme may result in relocation of energy-intensive production in less-constrained regions.\r\n28. “Best Available Technology” (BAT) isa commercial technology that provides the greatest reduction in GHG emissions after taking into consideration energy, economic,and environmental impacts."
