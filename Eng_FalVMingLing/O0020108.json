			"number": 300,
			"content": "The following factors shall be taken into account whilst setting up each periodic regulatory goal in line with the long-term national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction goal, pursuant to Paragraph 1 of Article 4 of the Act:\r\n1.Taking fairness and common but differentiated international responsibilities.\r\n2.Cost effectiveness: ensuring that GHG emission reduction goal will be achieved with the lowest cost, and the reasonable economic efficiency and break-even method.\r\n3.Utilizing scientific knowledge and technology relevant to climate change, including domestic applications and feasible technologies for climate change.\r\n4.Circumstances associated with economic and industrial development, including considerations associated with the likely impact on economic and industrial competitiveness.\r\n5.Financial circumstances, including the likely impact on taxes, public revenues and expenditures and government debt financing.\r\n6.Societal circumstances, including the likely effect of the energy costs, lives and properties for special circumstances families, low and middle-income households.\r\n7.Energy policies, including the likely impact on the establishment of energy infrastructure, energy prices and low-carbon energy selection on stable energy supply and electricity emission factor.\r\n8.Environmental effect, including the likely impact of the GHG emission reduction actions on environmental quality in varying dimensions.\r\n9.The implementation status of the imported fossil fuels taxation mechanism.\r\n10.The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its agreements, or relevant decisions made under international conventions.\r\n11.Other matters identified by the central competent authority."

			"content": "The periodic regulatory goal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Action Plan (Action Plan) shall cover national and sector-based periodic regulatory goals pursuant to Paragraph 1 of Article 9 of the Act. The determination of respective periodic regulatory goals shall be assessed on the basis of implementation within 10 years of each respective stage. \r\nElectricity consumption emissions of the sector-based periodic regulatory goal shall be estimated according to the periodic electricity emission factor goal. The periodic electricity emission goal and the responsibility of the reduction of public utilities shall be defined by the energy sector’s periodic regulatory goal. Moreover, the allowance of the indirectly emitted CO2 provided by the public utilities shall be deducted.\r\nThe deviation between the actual electricity emission factor pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and the periodic electricity emission factor goal multiplied by electricity sales volume shall be the responsibility of the energy sector."
