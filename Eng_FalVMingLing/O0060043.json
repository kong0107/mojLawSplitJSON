Impurity refers to an unintended constituent present in a substance as produced. It originates from the starting materials or is the result of secondary or incomplete reactions during the production process. While it is present along with the final substance it was not intentionally added, nor does it enhance the commercial value of that substance. The concentration of an individual impurity is no more than 10% (w/w). All impurities presented are no more than 20% (w/w).\r\nXII.    Scientific Research and Development refers to any scientific experimentation, education, analysis, or chemical research carried out under strictly controlled conditions.\r\nXIII.
