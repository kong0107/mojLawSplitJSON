Methods for collecting such evidence include inquiries, examination of written documents, and observation.\r\nB. When assessing the effectiveness of the design of the internal control system, CPAs shall focus on whether the overall internal control system achieves a given goal rather than whether any given specific operation of the internal control system is inappropriate.\r\nC. When engaged only to evaluate the effectiveness of the design of the internal control system, CPAs shall conduct necessary control tests based on actual needs.\r\n4. Testing and assessing the operating effectiveness of the internal control system:\r\nA. CPAs shall conduct control tests to collect evidence regarding the operation of the internal control system to provide a basis for assessing the operating effectiveness of the internal control system.\r\nB. Methods for conducting control tests by CPAs include inquiries, examination of written documents, observation, and re-testing. Control tests shall be conducted until sufficient and appropriate evidence has been collected. Evidence collected by the audited company during self-assessment of the internal control system shall not be substituted directly for evidence to be collected by the CPAs.\r\nC. Whether the evidence collected by CPAs is sufficient and appropriate is affected by the following factors: the nature of the audited company's internal control procedures, the importance of the internal control procedures to attainment of the control objectives, the probability of violation of control procedures by the audited company, the nature and extent of control tests already conducted by the audited company, and the CPAs' preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the control procedures. CPAs shall also execute necessary procedures and collect necessary evidence regarding subsequent events during the post audit period."
