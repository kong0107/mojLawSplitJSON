Definition: Gum arabic is a dried exudate obtained from the stems and branches of strains of Acacia senegal (L.) Willdenow or closely related species of Acacia (family Leguminosae). It consists mainly of high-molecular weight polysaccharides and their calcium, magnesium and potassium salts, which on hydrolysis yield arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid.\r\n2. Description and Identification: The unground product occurs as white to orange-brown, spheroidal tears of varying size or in angular fragments. Gum arabic is also available commercially in the form of white to yellowish-white flakes, granules, powder, roller dried, or spray-dried material. One gram dissolves in 2 mL of water, forming a solution that flows readily and is acid to litmus, insoluble in ethanol.\r\n3. Purity:\r\n(1)Loss on drying: Not more than 15% (105°, 5 h) for granular and not more than 10% (105°, 4 h) for spray dried material.\r\n(2)Total ash: Not more than 4%.\r\n(3)Acid-insoluble ash : Not more than 0.5%.\r\n(4)Acid-insoluble matter : Not more than 1%.\r\n(5)Starch or dextrin: Boil a 1 in 50 solution of the sample, cool and add a few drops of Iodine T.S. No bluish or reddish colour should be produced.\r\n(6)Tannin-bearing gums: To 10 mL of a 1 in 50 solution of the sample, add about 0.1 mL of ferric chloride TS.
