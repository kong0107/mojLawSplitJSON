The board of directors and management shall prescribe internal standards of conduct, including the adoption of code of conduct for directors and employees.\r\n2. Risk assessment: A precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of objectives, linked at different levels of a specialized electronic payment institution, and with the suitability of the objectives for the institution taken into consideration.

The internal control system must have mechanisms to generate information necessary for planning, implementation, and monitoring, provide information to those who need it in a timely manner, and ensure the retention of complete financial, operational and compliance information. An effective internal control system shall have effective communication channels in place.\r\n5. Monitoring activities: Monitoring activities means ongoing evaluations, separate evaluations, or some combination of the two used by a specialized electronic payment institution to ascertain whether each of the components of internal control is present and continuously functioning. Ongoing evaluations means routine evaluations built into the course of operations at different levels of the institution. Separate evaluations are evaluations of other personnel conducted by internal auditors, supervisors or audit committee, or the board of directors. Findings of deficiencies of the internal control system shall be communicated to the management of appropriate levels, the board of directors, and supervisors or audit committee, and improvements shall be made in a timely manner.\r\nThe minimum requirement for directors’ code of conduct specified in Subparagraph 1 of the preceding paragraph shall incorporate that, the directors must not only take adequate actions promptly when the specialized electronic institution are found to face foreseeable material damages, but also have to notify the audit committee or  independent directors or supervisors, and the board as well as instruct the said institution to report to the competent authority."
