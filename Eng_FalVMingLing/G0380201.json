			"content": "In the case where applying institutions encounter one of the following situations as a result of the CDIC's review, i.e., in the case where they do not conform to the insured qualifications, the CDIC shall report this to the competent authority or the central competent authority of agricultural finance to urge them to make improvements:\r\n1.
