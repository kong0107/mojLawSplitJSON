The major financial statements shall also be signed or sealed on each page by the insurance enterprise’s chairperson, managerial officer, and chief accounting officer.\r\nWhen an insurance enterprise applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial reports, or when it reclassifies items in its financial reports, it shall do so in accordance with the applicable provisions of IAS 1.\r\nFor the purposes of these Regulations, information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring the information in the financial reports could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of information in those financial reports. Judgments of materiality depend on qualitative factors and quantitative factors. Whether information is quantitatively material is assessed by considering not only the size of the impact recognized in the financial report, but also any unrecognized items that could ultimately affect primary users' overall perception of the insurance enterprise financial position, financial performance and cash flows (e.g., contingent liabilities or contingent assets). When assessing qualitative factors, consideration shall be given to both insurance enterprise-specific and external qualitative factors, including involvement of a related party, uncommon transactions or features of a transaction, unexpected variation or changes in trends, the insurance enterprise geographical location, its industry sector, or the state of the economy or economies in which it operates."

			"content": "An insurance enterprise shall comply with the following provisions when making accounting change:\r\n1. Change in accounting policy:\r\n(1)\"Accounting policies\" refer to specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices adopted by an insurance enterprise in preparing and presenting financial statements.\r\n(2)When an insurance enterprise changes an accounting policy voluntarily in a new fiscal year in order to produce financial reports that provide reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions or other events or conditions on the insurance enterprise’s financial position, financial performance, or cash flows, it shall request its certified public accountant (CPA) to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the change in accounting policy, the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable and more relevant information, each line item affected and the estimated effect for the fiscal year preceding the earliest fiscal year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding fiscal year. These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors (council), after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval. Upon approval by the FSC, the insurance enterprise shall publicly announce the estimated effects arising from the application of the new accounting policy and the CPA review opinion.\r\n(3)If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new fiscal year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the insurance enterprise shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item, and shall request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the fiscal year preceding the change in accounting policy. The insurance enterprise shall then follow the procedure described above.\r\n(4)Unless it is impracticable to determine the effects as described in the preceding item, an insurance enterprise shall, within 2 months after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the new accounting policy is adopted, calculate the line items affected and the actual effect for the fiscal year preceding the earliest fiscal year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding fiscal year, and shall submit the calculations for adoption by the board of directors (council), after which they shall be publicly announced and filed and submitted to the FSC for recordation. If the difference between the actual effect of the change in accounting policy and the original estimated effect in public announcement and filing is NT$10 million or more, and exceeds 1% of the  insurance revenue for the immediately preceding fiscal year or 5% of the paid-in capital, the insurance enterprise shall analyze the reasons for the difference and request a CPA to provide an opinion on its reasonableness. The analysis and the CPA's opinion shall also be publicly announced and filed with the FSC.\r\n(5)Except when an insurance enterprise applies a new accounting policy to newly purchased assets, in which case the provisions of the preceding items need not apply, if a change in accounting policy is adopted without having been duly filed for approval, the financial reports for the fiscal year in which the new accounting policy was applied shall be restated, and the new accounting policy may only be applied starting from the next fiscal year after a supplementary filing has been made and approved.\r\n(6)When an insurance enterprise voluntarily changes its accounting policy after the start date of a fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, it shall publicly announce and file the change period that the new accounting policy applies retroactively, line items affected and the actual effect for the immediately preceding fiscal year, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding fiscal year, and add an explanation to the reasonableness and necessity of changing the accounting policy or accounting estimates after the start date of a fiscal year. The insurance enterprise shall also request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of changes and other items. These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors (council) and then handled the same according to the procedure set out in Item (2) of the Subparagraph 1. If the effect of an insurance enterprise’s retrospective application of a new accounting policy on the financial statements for any quarter of the current fiscal year reaches the threshold for restatement of financial reports set out in Paragraph 2, Article 5 of these Regulations, the insurance enterprise shall restate the financial report for the relevant period and request the attesting CPAs to re-audit or review the financial statements and then public announce and file the report again.\r\n2.Changes in accounting estimates:\r\n(1)\"Accounting estimates\" means amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty and are estimated by an insurance enterprise using measurement techniques and inputs.\r\n(2)If a change in an accounting estimate arises from a change in the useful life or the depreciation or depletion method of depreciable or depletable assets, a change in the amortization period or amortization method of intangible assets, a change in the residual value of any such assets, or a change in a technique used to estimate the fair value thereof, the insurance enterprise shall request the attesting CPAs to provide an analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of changes and the reasons why the changes can provide reliable and more relevant information. Those changes in accounting estimates shall then be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors (council), publicly disclosed and filed after approval by the FSC, and then handled the same according to the procedure set out in Item (5) of the preceding subparagraph. If the insurance enterprise makes a change in an accounting estimate during a fiscal year, the insurance enterprise shall do the same as described in Item (6) of the preceding subparagraph, and in addition, provide explanations on the reasonableness and necessity of the time of the change.\r\nThe expression \"publicly announce and file\" as used in this article means entering the information into the website designated by the FSC for the submission of electronic filings.\r\nWhere an insurance enterprise has established the position of independent director, when it submits proposals for adoption by resolution of the board of directors (council) pursuant to Paragraph 1 hereof, it shall take into full consideration each independent director's opinion; where an independent director has an objection or reservation, the objection or reservation shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors."

Investments accounted for using the equity method:\r\n(1)    The valuation and presentation of investments accounted for using the equity method shall be made in accordance with IAS 28.\r\n(2)    When investment gain or loss is recognized, if the financial report prepared by an associate do not conform to these Regulations, the financial report shall first be adjusted to achieve conformance before it may be used to recognize investment gain or loss. The financial report of an associate to which the equity method applies shall be prepared as of the same date as that of the investor, and if prepared as of a different date, adjustments shall be made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between that date and the date of the investor's financial report. However, under no circumstances should the difference between the balance sheet date of the associate and that of the investor be longer than three months. If a CPA determines, pursuant to Standards on Auditing 320, that an associate has a material effect on the fair presentation of the financial report of an investor, the financial report of the associate shall be audited by a CPA in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Certification of Financial Statements by Certified Public Accountants and the Standards on Auditing .\r\n(3)    If an investment accounted for using the equity method is pledged as collateral or otherwise subject to any restriction or limitation, the fact shall be noted.\r\n10.

Investment property:\r\n(1)    Investment property shall mean property held, by the owner or by the lessee with the right of use, to earn rentals, or for capital appreciation, or both.\r\n(2)    Investment property shall be accounted for in accordance with IAS 40, and investment property that is subsequently measured using the fair value model shall be subject to the following provisions:\r\nA.     Fair value measurement shall use income approach or cost approach. However the preceding provision does not apply to investment properties that have been subsequently measured after initial recognition using the fair value model prior to the promulgation of the amendment on May 11, 2020, in which case, valuation shall use market value as basis of fair value measurement, and may not be performed based on specific market value, specified market value or special value.\r\nB.     An investment property that is leased out with a lease term of more than one year shall be measured using the income approach and subject to the following provisions:\r\na.     Cash flow: Cash flow shall be valued on the basis of existing lease. If there is an end-of-period value, the present value of the end-of-period value may be added.\r\nb.     Analysis period: When there is no specified period for the income, the analysis period should not be longer than the years of the property’s physical durability; when there is a specified period for the income, the income shall be estimated for the remainder of the specified period.\r\nc.     Discount rate: The discount rate shall be determined using the risk premium approach only, with the calculation based on a certain interest rate, plus an estimate based on the individual characteristics of the investment property. The term \"based on a certain interest rate\" means the interest rate may not be lower than the floating interest rate offered by the Chunghwa Post Co., Ltd. for 2-year time deposit of a small amount, plus 1.25 percentage points.\r\nC.     An investment property without a lease term of more than one year or with a lease that has been terminated, rescinded or nullified for more than one year shall be measured using the cost approach.\r\nD.

In addition, an insurance enterprise shall obtain an appraisal report issued by an appraiser at least once every half a year.\r\nE.     When the valuation of any single investment property held is above NT$1 billion, an insurance enterprise shall engage at least two joint appraisers offices to conduct the appraisal.\r\nF.      Property valuation shall use market value as basis of fair value measurement, and may not be performed based on specific market value, specified market value or special value.\r\nG.    If an insurance enterprise uses the fair value model for subsequent measurement of investment property, it shall adopt the same model for all of its investment property in accordance with IAS 40. However for vacant lands, an insurance enterprise shall measure the property in accordance with paragraph 53 of IAS 40 after obtaining construction license and undertaking development, and describe the change in the Notes for the current year.\r\nH.

The appraiser does not have a related party or substantive related party relationship as defined in IAS 24 with the insurance company requesting valuation service.\r\ng.     The appraiser does not have a record of poor credit in connection with negotiable instruments or with debt in the most recent 3 years nor a record of being subject to disciplinary action by a real estate appraiser disciplinary board in the most recent 5 years.\r\nI.      The appraiser shall issue a statement undertaking at least that he or she does not have a direct or indirect substantive relationship with the insurance enterprise requesting appraisal service and the legal consequences of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failing to perform due professional care.\r\nJ.      An insurance enterprise shall establish operating procedures for real estate valuation and include them in its internal control system. The procedures shall encompass the professional qualifications and conditions to be met by the outsourced joint appraisers office and appraisers, obtaining and analysis of information, checking the pertinence of appraised value and external appraisal report and preservation of relevant documents. The documentation regarding the checking of external appraisal report shall present information on which the checking is based and reasons for the conclusion reached, and shall be signed by the responsible officer. In addition, the checking shall cover at least whether the contents of the appraisal report are complete with respect to the following: basic data on the subject property, appraisal date, transactions of comparable properties located in the area of the subject property, assumptions and limitations of the appraisal, appraisal method and procedures, the pertinence of conclusions reached, and appraisal reporting date, whether there is error in the calculation of appraised value, whether assumptions made in the appraisal or reference data quoted are inappropriate or erroneous, and the reasonableness and veracity of appraisal parameters that have significant influence on the appraisal results. The checking documents shall be retained for at least 5 years for future reference of the competent authority.\r\nK.     A CPA shall review the appraisal report issued by a joint appraisers office engaged by an insurance enterprise in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards No. 71 Standards on Auditing 620. The review process performed by the CPA shall be double checked item-by-item by the professional evaluation team in the office the CPA works for so as to confirm the reasonableness of the methods and calculations used and made in the appraisal report.\r\nL.     The professional evaluation team at the CPA office described above should include a member meeting ROC’s qualification requirements for real estate appraiser. If not, the CPA office may engage the service of an external real estate appraiser that meets the qualification requirements set out in Item (2). H. hereof.\r\nM.    Disclosure of investment property that is subsequently measured using the fair value model, in addition to being handled in accordance with IAS 40, shall include the following information in the Notes:\r\na.     Description of the appropriateness and reasonableness of appraisal methods used and important assumptions and parameters used;\r\nb.
