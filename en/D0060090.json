Surveying: means the process of collecting, analyzing, calculating, valuing, integrating, and managing for a land with its geographic information that have the character of spatial layout.\r\n3. Mapping: means the process of displaying specifically the terrain features, surface features, and varieties of natural and human materials according to the result of surveying.\r\n4. Map: means the final work or related result of mapping.\r\n5. Basic survey: means processing a survey as the basic of surveying and mapping for the purpose of establishing a national survey datum and basic control point.\r\n6. Survey datum: the basic datum for land surveying and mapping, including the geodetic datum, the vertical datum, the depth datum and the gravity datum and so forth.\r\n7. Reference system: the system that is built by using the survey datum as the basic control survey references, including the coordinate system, the vertical system, the gravity system and other relevant systems.\r\n8. Basic control survey: the surveying which is conducted by utilizing the information such as the fine calculation of points coordinates, altitude or other relevant data as the basis of surveying and mapping and of which the purpose is to put into consideration the need for a nation-wide overall control surveying.\r\n9. Encrypted control survey: the sub-control survey that is carried out based on the basic control survey and of which the purpose is for the need to conduct the regional control survey.\r\n10. Applied survey: Any survey conducted for the purpose of specific benefits and advantages. This excludes the basic survey.\r\n11. Survey marks: the control points which are set up to carry out the surveying. The ones that are required to be maintained for good with clear marking are “permanent survey marks”. The ones which are maintained until the completive day of the surveying are temporary survey marks.\r\n12. Surveying and mapping results: the images, data, maps, graphics, information and other relevant results obtained according to the purpose of the surveying and mapping.\r\n13. Basic topographic maps: the topographic maps which are drawn by using surveying and mapping data gathered with the utilization of the basic scale (authorized by the relevant central government agencies). These maps include data such as the main terrain, land features and basic geographic information.\r\n14. Administrative maps: maps that include the administrative borders, location of the governments of such administrative regions and relevant geographic information.\r\n15. Charts: maps with topics related to the submarine topography below the lowest low-water line and hydrological data.\r\n16. Aerial survey photography and remote sensing: operations of which the purpose is to utilize aircrafts or satellites as the platform for equipments such as cameras or sensors to capture images of the surface of the lands and other relevant information.\r\n17. Geographic names: the names of specific locations, regions or geographic entities on the surface of the land, including physical geographic features, administrative regions, settlements, streets or public facilities that serve as landmarks.\r\n18. Standardized geographic names: the geographic names which are pronounced by this Act and used by all the government organizations.\r\n19. Survey industry: the professional engineer offices, companies or professional engineering consulting firms that are engaged in the surveying and mapping business according to this act."
