Pilot-in-Command (PIC). The pilot designated by the operator, or the owner, as being in command and charged with the safe conduct of a flight.\r\n11. Cabin crew member. A crew member who performs, in the interest of safety of passengers, duties assigned by the operator or the pilot-in-command of the aircraft, but who shall not act as a flight crew member.\r\n12. Flight manual. A manual approved by the State of Design or a manual accepted by the Civil Aeronautics Administrations(CAA), Minister of Transportations and Communications(MOTC) and associated with the certificate of airworthiness, containing limitations within which the aircraft is to be considered airworthy, and instructions and information necessary to the flight crew members for the safe operation of the aircraft.\r\n13. Flight operations manual. A manual established by the operator, containing general policy, regulations and limitations for the flight operations of the aircraft. The manual is established in accordance with CAA and aircraft manufacture’s instructions.\r\n14. Aircraft operating manual. A manual, established by the aircraft manufacturer, or amended by the specified operator containing normal, abnormal and emergency procedures, checklists, limitations, performance information, details of the aircraft systems and other material relevant to the operation of the aircraft.\r\n15. General maintenance manual. A manual established by the operator, containing general policy, requirements and standards for the maintenance of each type aircraft operated by the operator. The manual is established in accordance with CAA and aircraft manufacture’s instructions and other material relevant to the maintenance of the aircraft.\r\n16. Aeronautical charts. A representation of a portion of the Earth, its culture and relief, specifically designated to meet the requirements of air navigation.\r\n17. Alternate aerodrome. Alternate aerodromes include the following:\r\na) Take-off alternate. An alternate aerodrome at which an aircraft can land should this become necessary shortly, after take off.\r\nb) En route alternate. An alternate aerodrome at which an aircraft would be able to land after experiencing an abnormal or emergency condition while en route.\r\nc) Destination alternate. An alternate aerodrome to which an aircraft may proceed should it become either impossible or inadvisable to land at the aerodrome of intended landing.\r\n18. Flight time. The time regarded for the calculation from the moment that flight crew members commence the flight duty and the limitation of flight time log.\r\na) Airplane. The total time from the moment an airplane first moves for the purpose of taking off until the moment it finally comes to rest after landing.\r\nb) Helicopters. The total time from the moment a helicopter’s rotor blades start turning until the moment the helicopter finally comes to rest at the end of the flight, and the rotor blades are stopped.\r\n19. Service time. The total time from the moment an aircraft lifts off the ground until the moment it touches down at the end of the flight. It is for calculation and record keeping of service time of the aircraft, engine, propeller, installations and equipment thereof, unless the maintenance manual requires otherwise.\r\n20. Duty Period. A period which starts when a flight or cabin crew member is required by an operator to report for or to commence a duty and ends when that person is free from all duties. These duties are, but are not limited to: flight duty, administrative work, training, positioning and standby; should have been included into duty rosters.\r\n21. Rest period. A continuous and defined period of time, subsequent to and/or prior to duty, during which flight or cabin crew members are free of all duties.\r\n22. Rest place.

Decision height (DH). A specified height in the precision approach or approach with vertical guidance at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. Decision height (DH) is referenced to the threshold elevation.\r\n28. Decision attitude (DA). A specified attitude in the precision approach or approach with vertical guidance at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established.
