      "EngArticleContent": "The terms as employed in these regulations are defined as follows:\r\n1.Gene transfer: it refers to the genetic recombination or introduce that the individuals, cells, embryos, embryonic stem cells or germ-cells of the breeding stock and fowl undergo because of the transferred gene that has been incorporated into the cells by using genetic engineering or molecular biotechnology.\r\n2.Transgene: it refers to the recombined gene or the gene, fragments of DNA or RNA that originally do not belong to the given breeding stock and fowl or genetic resource.\r\n3.Transgenic breeding livestock and fowl: it refers to the breeding stock and fowl or the genetic resource, which is obtained by applying gene transfer technique and incorporates transfer genes, as well as the progeny or clone derived from it.\r\n4.Field Trial: it refers to the trial carried out by an institute, which is sanctioned by the central competent authorities and which is capable of preventing the leak of transfer gene, for the purpose of bio-safety assessment.\r\n5.Bio-safety: it refers to the safety of the subjects of the transgenic breeding stock and fowl itself and the flora and fauna, human beings and natural environment that may interact with them."
