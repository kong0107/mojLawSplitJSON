			"content": "Terms and symbols used in these Standards are defined as follows:\r\nI.\"Dioxin\" means polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans.\r\nII.\"I-TEF\" means the International Toxicity Equivalency Factor used internationally to calculate the toxicity weighting of dioxin concentrations.\r\nIII.\"TEQ\" (Toxicity Equivalency Quantity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin) means the method of calculating the toxicity weighting of dioxin concentrations.\r\nIV.\"Newly established sintering plant\" means a sintering plant that was established on or after the date of promulgation of these Standards.\r\nV.\"Existing sintering plant\" means a sintering plant that is already constructed or that is in the process of being constructed, for which project tender procedures have been completed, or if no tenders were invited, for which project contracts were issued and signed before the date of promulgation of these Standards. However, a sintering plant for which the dioxin emissions has increased by more than 10% of the annual allowable emissions as set forth in the operating permit due to the replacement or enlargement of relevant equipment shall be deemed a newly established sintering plant."

The correction formula is as follows:\r\n     21－15\r\nC = ─────．CS\r\n     21－Os\r\n“C” means the pollutant concentration corrected to Standard Oxygen Basis, measured in ng-TEQ/Nm3.\r\n“Cs” means measured the pollutant concentration based on test method, not corrected to Standard Oxygen Basis, measured in ng-TEQ/Nm .\r\n“Os” means the actual measured emission oxygen content.

Monitoring facilities shall be installed for the real-time display of the exhaust gas temperature.\r\nDuring the normal operation of the sintering plant of the foregoing paragraph dioxin pollution prevention equipment shall be maintained at the operating conditions of the most recent sampling and analysis period that met dioxin emission standards. When the operating conditions of a sintering plant change, another dioxin sampling and analysis shall be conducted in order to adjust the operating conditions thereof."

The interval between the first and the second regular test may not be shorter than three months and not longer than nine months. Seven days before a regular test a test plan shall be submitted to the competent authority of the special municipality, county or city. The test results shall be reported to said competent authority in a test report within 60 days after the test.\r\nII.If the emission dioxin concentrations of two consecutive regular tests meet the emission standard values of Article 5, relevant documentary proof may be submitted to the competent authority of the special municipality, county or city to apply for an adjustment of the test frequency to once a year. However, if the results of an investigative test by the competent authority or the results of a regular test at a plant that has already been adjusted to one annual regular test violate the regulations of Article 5, tests shall be performed in accordance with the frequency determined in the foregoing paragraph."
