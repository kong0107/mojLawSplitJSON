The most commonly used oxygenates are methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), ethanol, and methanol.\r\n7.\"Aromatics content\" means the total amount of benzene, methylbenzene, ethylbenzene, xylene and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds above C9 in gasoline.\r\n8.\"Olefins content\" means total amount of olefins in gasoline.\r\n9.\"Cetane index\" is a method of expressing the ignition performance of diesel fuel, and is calculated based on the density and distillation temperature in accordance with the Chinese National Standard 12016 (CNS 12016) or 12761 (CNS 12761).\r\n10.\"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) content\" means the total amount of aromatic hydrocarbons contained in diesel excluding monocyclic aromatics.\r\n11.\"Gasohol\" means fossil gasoline blended with fuel ethanol, or denatured fuel ethanol not blended with fossil gasoline and used directly as a fuel.\r\n12.\"Biodiesel\" means fossil diesel fuel blended with fatty acid methyl ester, or fatty acid methyl ester not blended with fossil diesel fuel and used directly as a fuel.\r\n13.“Ships fuel” means fuel used in any ship engine, boiler or other combustion equipment, including marine gas oil, marine diesel oil and fishing boat fuel.\r\n14.“Aviation fuel” means aviation kerosene and aviation gasoline added to commercial aircrafts."
