Once the bidding price submitted, the bid will be opened at rounds two to nine. After the price bidding for round ten is completed, the single-listed bidding form shall be first opened so that the temporary winning bidder of round nine may consider raising the bid for the same subject. Round ten may not begin unless the temporary winning bidder of round nine has submitted its bidding form or decided not to raise its bid or unless the consideration time has ended.\r\n4. When opening the bid for round ten, the bidding form from bidders other than the temporary winning bidder shall be opened first; the bidding form of the temporary winning bidder of round nine may not be opened unless the biddings from the other bidders are deemed valid. If the biddings from bidders other than the temporary winning bidders are all deemed invalid, then the bidding form of the temporary winning bidder of round nine will not be opened; the temporary winning bidder of round nine shall be the temporary winning bidder of round ten and the temporary winning bidding price of round nine shall be the temporary winning bidding price of round ten."
