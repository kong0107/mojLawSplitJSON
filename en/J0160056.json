      "EngArticleContent": "Definitions\r\nThe terms used in this Act are defined as follows:\r\n(1)Nuclear Accident refers to an emergency occurring in a nuclear reactor facility whose response organization fails to eliminate the causes of the accident promptly and to prevent enlargement of the hazard, thereby leading to the release of radioactive material or concern of possible release, which is sufficient to give rise to an accident of radiation detriment.\r\n(2)Nuclear Reactor Facility refers to an installation with nuclear fuel in appropriate array where the self-sustained chain reaction of controllable nuclear fission can take place together with its associated buildings and equipment; several nuclear reactor facilities installed at the same site by the same licensee are regarded as one reactor facility.\r\n(3)Research Nuclear Reactor Facility refers to a nuclear reactor facility mainly for the purpose of teaching, research, or experimentation.\r\n(4)Nuclear Reactor Facility Licensee refers to a licensee that has been designated or approved by the government to operate the nuclear reactor facility.\r\n(5)Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) refers to a zone where the emergency response plan must be carried out and the public protective measures must be taken immediately upon the occurrence of a nuclear accident.\r\n(6)Preparedness Measures refer to various actions of planning, organizing, training, and exercising that are taken in advance at ordinary times and can be adopted promptly upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a nuclear accident.\r\n(7)Response Measures refer to measures to be taken upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a nuclear accident with various actions of preventing continual deterioration of the accident and protecting the safety, health and properties of the public.\r\n(8)Recovery Measures refer to relevant protective measures needed to complete temporary relocation, area control of access and egress, and control of food and drinking water after the nuclear accident has been controlled and deterioration no longer continues but before the accident affected area may be recovered to its normal living conditions.\r\n(9)Designated Agency refers to a governmental agency designated by the Executive Yuan to carry out emergency response affairs for nuclear accidents.\r\n(10)Public Protection refers to measures taken upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a nuclear accident to reduce radiation exposure and protect the safety, health of the public. Such measures include sheltering, iodine tablet administration, evacuation and accommodation, control of food and drinking water, temporary relocation, area control of access and egress, decontamination and cleanup, and medical aid.\r\n(11)Sheltering refers to an action taken by the public to stay indoors with windows, doors, and ventilation systems promptly closed, so as to reduce the possibility of inhaling radionuclides and receiving radiation exposure.\r\n(12)Iodine Tablet refers to the drug potassium iodide (KI); as a certain dosage is taken timely upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a nuclear accident, it can prevent the released radionuclide from depositing in the thyroid glands, so as to avoid or reduce the thyroid cancer morbidity.\r\n(13)Emergency Response Plan refers to the emergency response basic plan, the public protection plan within the EPZ, or the emergency response plan of a nuclear reactor facility.\r\n(14)Emergency Response Basic Plan refers to a general emergency response plan for nuclear accidents laid down by the central Competent Authority in consultation with the designated agencies.\r\n(15)Public Protection Plan within the EPZ refers to a regional public protective response plan for nuclear accidents laid down by the local governments governing the EPZ in order to ensure public safety in the region.\r\n(16)Emergency Response Plans for the Nuclear Reactor Facility refer to on-site and offsite emergency response plans for nuclear accidents laid down by the licensee of a nuclear reactor facility for taking the rescue of the facility and in coordination with public protective operations in the region."
