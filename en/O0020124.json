The calculation method is the high heating value minus the heating value of the heat in the state of steam generated by the moisture during combustion.\r\nX.      “Dried basis” refers to the test specimen based on the anhydrous state to arrive at an analysis result.\r\nXI.     “Air-dried basis” refers to the test specimen based on measurement after it is air dried to arrive at an analysis result.\r\nXII.    “Wet basis” refers to the test specimen based on measurements without air-drying and the state with total water content, to arrive at an analysis result.\r\nXIII.   “Co-firing” refers to a situation of burning waste-derived fuels, or burning more than two kinds of fuel at the same time, which include one or more waste products being used as fuel, in any stationary pollution source."

The equation is specified below:\r\nHw：Ratio of lower heating value input from waste derived fuels.\r\nHf：Ratio of lower heating value with the use of fuels, excluding waste derived fuels from stationary pollution sources, Hf =1-Hw.\r\nCw：The emission standards of incinerators expressed in ppm.\r\nCf：The emission standards of stationary pollution sources, expressed in ppm.\r\nC ：The concentration of exhaust from co-firing with waste derived fuels, expressed in ppm.\r\nIf the ratios of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides from the calculation of using waste derived fuels co-fired in public or private premises are different, the lower ratio should be used to regulate the co-firing ratio.\r\nThe regulation in Article 28 paragraph 1 is not applicable for co-firing proportions for: Waste-derived fuels used in public or private premises whose concentrations, based on monitoring and analysis for the past two years, of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides is lower than the incinerator emissions standard, or; if the concentrations are under 50% of the stationary source industry standards for sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides."
