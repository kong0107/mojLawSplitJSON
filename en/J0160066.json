			"number": 200,
			"content": "The terms used in the Regulations are defined as follows:\r\n1. Activity: the number of spontaneous disintegrations occurring in a certain amount of radionuclides at a given time.\r\n2. Specific activity: activity per unit mass.\r\n3. Release: the removal of solid radioactive waste from the facilities for recycling, burial and incineration."

			"number": 300,
			"content": "Clearance waste (hereinafter abbr. as the waste)referred to in the regulations means solid radioactive waste excluding the  following:\r\n1. Waste derived from naturally-occurring radioactive materials.\r\n2. Radioactive waste produced by patients discharged from hospital who have received nuclear medical diagnosis or treatment.\r\nThe clearance level for the waste described in above paragraphs shall be in accord with stipulations in the appendix table."

		{
			"number": 400,
			"content": "Radioactive waste with activity or specific activity below the clearance level described in Article 3 shall be allowed to be free released.\r\nTo implement the release of waste, a release plan specifying the following shall be submitted to the competent authority for approval prior to implementation:\r\n1. Managing organization and its responsibilities.\r\n2. Sources and characteristics of the waste.\r\n3. Measuring and analysis methods for the activity or specific activity of the waste.\r\n4. Method and location of the release waste.\r\n5. Quality assurance program.\r\n6. Other matters specified in a public announcement by the competent authority.\r\nThe release plan referred to in the above paragraph may be submitted as part of the radiation protection plan of a nuclear facility or organization using isotopes ."
