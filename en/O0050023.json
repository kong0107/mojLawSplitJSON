Waste liquid hydrogen ion concentration index (pH value) greater than or equal to 12.5 or less than or equal to 2.0; or items whose corrosion rate against steel (Republic of China national standard steel S20C) at 55°C exceeds 6.35mm per year.\r\nB. Solid waste in a soluble state whose liquid hydrogen ion concentration index (pH value) is greater than or equal to 12.5 or less than or equal to 2.0; or items whose corrosion rate against steel (Republic of China national standard steel S20C) at 55°C exceeds 6.35mm per year.\r\nⅥ\" Inflammable industrial waste\" refers to industrial waste possessing the following properties:\r\nA. Waste liquid which sparkles at less than 60°C. This does not include alcoholic beverage waste in which ethanol concentration is less than 24% by volume.\r\nB. Solid waste that can ignite and burn at a temperature of 25±2°C at atmospheric pressure (herein referred to as ambient conditions) due to friction, absorption of water, or spontaneous chemical reaction.\r\nC. Waste strong oxidizing agents that may directly release oxygen and induce the combustion of other materials.\r\nⅦ \"Reactive industrial waste\" refers to industrial waste possessing the following properties:\r\nA. Prone to cause an explosion at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure.\r\nB. Forms violently reactive or explosive substances or their mixtures when mixed with water.\r\nC. Containing cyanides and having a hydrogen ion concentration index (pH value) between 2.0 and 12.5 and capable of producing toxic entities of 250 mg HCN/kg or above.\r\nD. Containing sulfides and having a hydrogen ion concentration index (pH value) between 2.0 and 12.5 and capable of producing toxic entities of 500 mg H2S/kg or above.\r\nⅧ \"Asbestos and asbestos product waste\" refers to industrial waste possessing the following properties:\r\nA. Materials used for rubbing, such as fire prevention, heat insulation and thermal insulation material and brake pads, etc, whose manufacture involves asbestos and which, in the finishing processes of grinding, polishing and drilling, produce highly dispersible waste.\r\nB. Waste produced by the emission of asbestos in the course of construction.\r\nC. Highly dispersible waste produced in the course of renovating or removing fire prevention, heat insulation or thermal insulation materials containing asbestos.\r\nD. Containerized bag of which asbestos is a raw material.\r\nE. Other waste containing one percent or more asbestos and of a highly dispersible nature."
