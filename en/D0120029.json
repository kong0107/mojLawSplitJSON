It is located at the upper part of the    │\r\n│    side plate of the storage tank, and is provided with    │\r\n│    foam conduit or slide away and other auxiliary devices, │\r\n│    which prevent the foam from submerging into the liquid  │\r\n│    or agitating the liquid, and enable the foam to extin-  │\r\n│    guish the fire effectively. In addition, a device is    │\r\n│    provided to prevent the adverse flow of the public      │\r\n│    hazardous materials inside the storage tank.            │\r\n│(2) Type II foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which  │\r\n│    foam is injected from a fixed top or the upper part of a│\r\n│    storage tank. The outlet is attached with a foam reflec-│\r\n│    ting plate, which makes the discharged foam flow along  │\r\n│    the inner side of the side plate, prevents the foam from│\r\n│    submerging into the liquid or agitating the liquid, and │\r\n│    enables the foam to extinguish the fire effectively. In │\r\n│    addition, a device is provided to prevent the back flow │\r\n│    of the public hazardous materials inside the storage    │\r\n│    tank.                                                   │\r\n│(3) Special type foam outlet: refers to an outlet through   │\r\n│    which foam is injected from the upper part of the outer │\r\n│    floating top of a storage tank. The outlet is attached  │\r\n│    with a foam reflecting plate, which enables the foam to │\r\n│    be injected into the loop formed by the side plate of   │\r\n│    storage tank and the foam separator plate. The separator│\r\n│    plate is a steel plate installed more than 0.3m         │\r\n│    (inclusive) above the floating top and more than 0.3m   │\r\n│    (inclusive) away from the inner side of the storage tank│\r\n│    , and it is provided with a device to prevent the foam  │\r\n│    from flowing out and discharge the water effectively    │\r\n│    depending on the expected maximum rainfall in the area  │\r\n│    where the storage tank is set.                          │\r\n│(4) Type III foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which │\r\n│    foam is injected from the bottom of a fixed-top storage │\r\n│    tank. A foam transmission pipe (designed with a struc-  │\r\n│    ture or mechanism which can prevent the public hazardous│\r\n│    materials inside the storage tank from flowing adversely│\r\n│    through the pipe) is provided to transmit the foam gene-│\r\n│    rated by the foam generator into the storage tank, and  │\r\n│    discharge the foam through the outlet.                  │\r\n│(5) Type IV foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which  │\r\n│    foam is injected from the bottom of a fixed-top storage │\r\n│    tank. The tail end of the foam transmission pipe is     │\r\n│    connected to the special hose stored in the storage     │\r\n│    cylinder (designed with a cover which is easy to break  │\r\n│    off when foam is injected) located on the bottom under  │\r\n│    the liquid surface; when foam is injected, the special  │\r\n│    hose may be straightened to reach the front end of the  │\r\n│    special hose to the liquid surface, so as to discharge  │\r\n│    foam.                                                   │\r\n│B.If a special type foam outlet is installed on a floating  │\r\n│  top, installation of a foam reflecting plate shall be     │\r\n│  exempted.                                                 │\r\n│C.The Type III foam outlet in this table may be used only   │\r\n│  for the tanks processing or storing the public hazardous  │\r\n│  materials with a solubility of less than 1g in 100g of    │\r\n│  water under a temperature of 20℃ (hereinafter \"non-water-│\r\n│  soluble substances\" for short) and storing the public     │\r\n│  hazardous materials with a temperature of less than 50 or │\r\n│  with a dynamic viscosity of less than 100cst.             │\r\n│D.For the storage tank of inner floating top adopted with   │\r\n│  steel double deck or pantoon deck, the type and quantity  │\r\n│  of the foam outlets may be configured similarly as storage│\r\n│  tank of outer floating top                                │\r\n└──────────────────────────────┘\r\n2. When storing water-insoluble Category IV public hazardous materials, the effective discharging volume from the foam outlets specified in paragraph 1 is, according to the following “public hazardous
