If no winner can be determined, then the NCC shall administer a draw to determine the result. From rounds two to nine, if a bidder that offers the highest bidding price but is unable to win as the temporary winning bidder due to a draw, its bidding record shall be included in Round Ten as the number of wins of temporary winning bidder.\r\nThe bidding procedure from round two:\r\n1. The NCC shall issue a bidding price ballot for all bidders at every round, and an additional bidding subject ballot will be issued in round ten;\r\n2. Bidders shall submit a signed bidding form that contains a bidding price and bidding value in a sealed bidding envelope to the NCC staff within the time limit for every round; an additional single-listed bidding form that contains a bidding price for round ten shall be sealed in another envelope and submitted.\r\n3. Once the bidding price submitted, the bid will be opened at rounds two to nine. After the price bidding for round ten is completed, the single-listed bidding form shall be first opened so that the temporary winning bidder of round nine may consider raising the bid for the same subject. Round ten may not begin unless the temporary winning bidder of round nine has submitted its bidding form or decided not to raise its bid or unless the consideration time has ended.\r\n4. When opening the bid for round ten, the bidding form from bidders other than the temporary winning bidder shall be opened first; the bidding form of the temporary winning bidder of round nine may not be opened unless the biddings from the other bidders are deemed valid. If the biddings from bidders other than the temporary winning bidders are all deemed invalid, then the bidding form of the temporary winning bidder of round nine will not be opened; the temporary winning bidder of round nine shall be the temporary winning bidder of round ten and the temporary winning bidding price of round nine shall be the temporary winning bidding price of round ten."
