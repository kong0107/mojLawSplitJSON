			"條文內容": "The following shall apply when an FCM makes an accounting change:\r\n1.Change in accounting policy:\r\nA.When an FCM changes an accounting policy voluntarily in a new financial year in order to produce financial reports that provide reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions or other events or conditions on the FCM's financial position, financial performance, or cash flows, it shall request a certified public accountant (CPA) to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the change in accounting policy, the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable and more relevant information, each line item affected and the estimated effect for the financial year preceding the latest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy, and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year. These shall be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, after which they shall be submitted to the FSC for approval. Upon approval by the FSC, the FCM shall publicly disclose and file information on the estimated effect arising from the application of the new accounting policy and the CPA review opinion.\r\nB.If, for the voluntary change in accounting policy in the new financial year, it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, as described in paragraph 23 of IAS 8, the FCM shall calculate the effects in accordance with paragraph 24 of IAS 8 and the preceding item above, and shall request a CPA to provide an item-by-item analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the reasons why retrospective application is impracticable and how and from when the change in accounting policy has been applied, and also provide an opinion on the impact on the audit opinion for the financial year preceding the change in accounting policy. The FCM shall then follow the procedure described above.\r\nC.Unless it is impracticable to determine the effects as described in the preceding item, then within 2 months after the beginning of the financial year in which the new accounting policy is adopted, the FCM shall calculate the line items affected and the actual effect for the financial year preceding the latest financial year affected by retrospective application of the new accounting policy and the actual effect on the opening balance of retained earnings for the immediately preceding financial year, and shall submit those for adoption by the board of directors, after which they shall be publicly disclosed and filed and submitted to the FSC for recordation. If the difference between the actual effect of the change in accounting policy and the original estimated effect is NT$10 million or more, and is also 1 percent or more of the income for the immediately preceding financial year or 5 percent or more of paid-in capital, the FCM shall analyze the reasons for the difference and request a CPA to provide an opinion on its reasonableness. The analysis and the CPA's opinion shall also be publicly disclosed and filed with the FSC.\r\nD.Except when an FCM applies a new accounting policy to newly purchased assets, in which case the provisions of the preceding items need not be applied, and except when, after the beginning of a financial year, an FCM voluntarily changes an accounting policy during the year in which regulatory adjustments have come into force, in which case the FCM shall request a CPA to issue a review opinion and submit it for adoption by the board of directors and publicly disclose it and then shall file the review opinion and relevant materials with the FSC for recordation, if a change in accounting policy is applied without having been duly filed for approval, the financial reports for the financial year in which the new accounting policy was applied shall be restated, and the new accounting policy may only be applied from the next financial year after a supplementary submission has been made and approved.\r\nE.In the case of an FCM whose shares have a par value other than NT$10, in the calculation of the 5 percent of paid-in capital under item C, 2.5 percent of the equity attributable to owners of the parent as stated in the balance sheet shall be substituted.\r\n2.With respect to any matter among accounting estimates relating to a change in the useful life or depreciation method of depreciable assets, a change in the amortization period or amortization method of intangible assets, or a change in the residual value of any such assets, in addition to complying with item D of the preceding subparagraph, the FCM shall request a CPA to provide an analysis and review opinion on the reasonableness of the nature of the changes in accounting estimates and the reasons why the changes in accounting estimates can provide reliable and more relevant information. The changes in accounting estimates shall then be submitted as a proposal for adoption by resolution of the board of directors, and then submitted to the FSC for approval.\r\nThe expression \"public disclosure and filing\" or \"publicly disclose and file\" as used in the preceding paragraph means entering the information into the website designated by the FSC for the submission of electronic filings."
